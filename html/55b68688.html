<P>(d) <U>Redevelopment of Certain Commercial Land Uses.</U> In the event of a proposal to redevelop particular land uses identified in Section <A HREF="5559651b.html">1280.08</A>(b) if all of the following circumstances are met:

<P> (1) The redevelopment does not result in a change in existing land uses on the parcel(s).

<P> (2) The redevelopment does not add to the parcel(s) upon which the current land uses are located.

<P> (3) The parcel(s) upon which the current land use is located is so constrained in terms of size, shape or accessibility that the literal application of the provisions of Section <A HREF="5559651b.html">1280.08</A>(b) would be impractical or undesirable.

<P>Exemption from the requirements of Section <A HREF="5559651b.html">1280.08</A>(b) may be granted only to the extent necessary to compensate for the constraints identified in (3) above which are present on the site and which present a material obstacle to redevelopment. No exemption shall be granted which increases risk to the public health or safety.
