  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>(a) <U>Certain Residential Uses.</U> The lawful construction, alteration and occupancy of a single or two-family dwelling and buildings accessory thereto, with the exception of solar energy systems, as established in Section <A HREF='52f5c3a5.html?f=FifLink&amp;t=document-frame.htm&amp;l=jump&amp;iid=2708dbda.33f0517e.0.0&amp;nid=861#JD_127106'>1271.06</A> of the Planning and Zoning Code on a lot on which there exists no other principal building or use, and any lawful use, alteration or construction in the A-1 District, are exempt from this chapter.

  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY> (c) <U>Repairs and Maintenance.</U> The ordinary repair or maintenance of a building, structure, landscaping, screening or other site improvement shall not require the preparation or approval of a site plan. 

  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>(Ord. 00-16. Passed 2-17-00.)

  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY> (d) <U>Redevelopment of Certain Commercial Land Uses.</U> In the event of a proposal to redevelop particular land uses identified in Section <A HREF='5559651b.html?f=FifLink&amp;t=document-frame.htm&amp;l=jump&amp;iid=2708dbda.33f0517e.0.0&amp;nid=851#JD_128008'>1280.08</A>(b), the Planning Commission may exempt the proposed redevelopment from one or more of the provisions of <A HREF='5559651b.html?f=FifLink&amp;t=document-frame.htm&amp;l=jump&amp;iid=2708dbda.33f0517e.0.0&amp;nid=851#JD_128008'>1280.08</A>(b) if all of the following circumstances are met:

  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>  (1) The redevelopment does not result in a change in existing land uses on the parcel(s).

  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>  (2) The redevelopment does not add to the parcel(s) upon which the current land uses are located.

  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>  (3) The parcel(s) upon which the current land use is located is so constrained in terms of size, shape or accessibility that the literal application of the provisions of Section <A HREF='5559651b.html?f=FifLink&amp;t=document-frame.htm&amp;l=jump&amp;iid=2708dbda.33f0517e.0.0&amp;nid=851#JD_128008'>1280.08</A>(b) would be impractical or undesirable.

  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY> Exemption from the requirements of Section <A HREF='5559651b.html?f=FifLink&amp;t=document-frame.htm&amp;l=jump&amp;iid=2708dbda.33f0517e.0.0&amp;nid=851#JD_128008'>1280.08</A>(b) may be granted only to the extent necessary to compensate for the constraints identified in (3) above which are present on the site and which present a material obstacle to redevelopment. No exemption shall be granted which increases risk to the public health or safety.

  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>(Ord. 01-26. Passed 6-21-01.)
