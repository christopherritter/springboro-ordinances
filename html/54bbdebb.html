<H1>1278.04 NONCONFORMING LOTS OF RECORD.</H1>

  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>In any district in which single-family dwellings are permitted, a single-family dwelling and any customary accessory buildings may be erected on any single lot which is of record on the effective date of adoption or amendment of this Zoning Code (Ordinance 546B, passed February 25, 1976), notwithstanding limitations imposed by other provisions of this Zoning Code. Such lot must be in separate ownership and not of continuous frontage with other lots in the same ownership. This section shall apply even though such lot fails to meet the requirements for area or width, or both, that are generally applicable in the district, provided that yard dimensions or requirements, other than those applying to area or width, or both, of the lot, shall conform to the regulations for the district in which such lot is located. Variance of yard requirements shall be obtained only through action of the Board of Zoning Appeals.

  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>(Ord. 99-20. Passed 5-6-99.)
