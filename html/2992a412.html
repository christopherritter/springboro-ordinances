<P>(b) It is no defense to a charge under subsection (a)(6) hereof that the oath or affirmation was administered or taken in an irregular manner.

<P>(c) If contradictory statements relating to the same fact are made by the offender within the period of the statute of limitations for falsification, it is not necessary for the prosecution to prove which statement was false, but only that one or the other was false.
