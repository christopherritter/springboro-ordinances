<H1>840.21 ADVERTISING AND LIGHTING REGULATIONS.</H1>

<P>(a) It shall be unlawful and a person commits a first degree misdemeanor if he/she operates or causes to be operated a sexually oriented business, regardless of whether or not a permit has been issued for said business under this chapter, and advertises the presentation of any activity prohibited by any applicable State statute or local ordinance.

<P>(b) It shall be unlawful and a person commits a first degree misdemeanor if he/she operates or causes to be operated a sexually oriented business, regardless of whether or not a permit has been issued or said business under this chapter, and displays or otherwise exhibits the materials and/or performances at such sexually oriented business in any advertising which is visible outside the premises. This prohibition shall not extend to lawful advertising of the name, nature or location of such sexually oriented business.

<P>(c).  The permittee shall not allow any portion of the interior premises to be visible from outside the premises and shall not allow any activity conducted on the premises to be visible from any location off the premises.

<P>(d) All off-street parking areas and premise entries of the sexually oriented business shall be illuminated from dusk to closing hours of operation with a lighting system which provides an average maintained horizontal illumination of one foot candle of light on the parking surface and/or walkways. This required lighting level is established in order to provide sufficient illumination of the parking areas and walkways serving the sexually oriented business for the personal safety of patrons and employees and to reduce the incidence of vandalism and criminal conduct. The lighting shall be shown on the sketch or diagram of the premise required as part of the permit application process.

<P>(Ord. 96-20. Passed 3-7-96.)
