<H1>1224.07 PROCEDURES FOR ESTABLISHMENT; HOUSING OFFICER; HOUSING COUNCIL.</H1>

<P>(a) <U>Generally.</U> Detailed procedures concerning the establishment of a community reinvestment area, definitions, the appointment of a Housing Officer, applications for exemption from taxation, revocation, the Housing Council and appeals are contained in Ohio R.C. 3735.65 through 3765.70 and are hereby adopted as if wholly rewritten herein.

<P>(b) <U>Step by Step Procedures.</U> The following is a synopsis of the step by step procedures to implement and operate a community reinvestment program.

<P> (1) The local legislative authority surveys the housing within its jurisdiction.

<P> (2) The local legislative authority adopts a resolution describing the boundaries of the community reinvestment area and containing a statement of finding concerning the housing facilities or structures of historical significance within the area.

<P> (3) The adopted resolution is published in a newspaper of general circulation once a week for two consecutive weeks.

<P> (4) The local legislative authority shall designate a Housing Officer to administer such program.

<P> (5) The property owner files an application for exemption.

<P> (6) The Housing Officer verifies the new construction or remodeling and forwards the application to the County Auditor.

<P> (7) A Community Reinvestment Area Housing Council shall be appointed for each such area.

<P> (8) The Housing Officer and the Housing Council shall make annual inspections of properties for which an exemption has been granted.

<P>  (Ord. 915. Passed 12-4-80.)

<P>(c) <U>Initiating Authorities.</U> Council may institute a community reinvestment program by completing steps (1) through (4) of subsection (b) hereof and ensuring that the Housing Council is constituted according to the Ohio Revised Code.

<P>The owner of any designated real property in a designated community reinvestment area may file an application for exemption from real property taxation, for any new construction or remodeling of sufficient dollar value, completed after the effective date of the resolution adopted by Council describing the boundaries of the area. (Ord. 00-22. Passed 4-6-00.)

<P>(d) <U>Method of Application.</U> Any owner of real property in a designated community reinvestment area may obtain an application for exemption from real property taxation by either visiting or writing the Housing Officer at the Municipal Building, 280 W. Central Avenue, Springboro, Ohio 45066, and requesting an application form. If request for an application form is made by letter, it should identify the owner, the reinvestment area involved and the location, and should also contain a description of the present property and a brief description and approximate dollar value of the proposed or underway improvement and, if the work has already been completed, the date of such completion. Depending on the nature and size of the improvement, either a short form application or a more complete questionnaire (copies of which are codified as Appendices A and B immediately following this chapter) will be supplied to the applicant. When necessary, additional questions or instructions may be appended to the application by the Housing Officer.

<P>(e) <U>Action by the Housing Officer.</U> Upon receipt of a completed application, the Housing Officer shall verify the construction of the new building, the costs of the remodeling and facts asserted in the application. If the proposed improvement complies with all of the requirements for tax exemption, the Housing Officer shall forward the application to the County Auditor with a certification as to the section of the Ohio Revised Code under which the exemption is granted and the period of the exemption, in years, as determined by the legislative authority pursuant to that division.

<P>(f) <U>Starting Date of the Exemption.</U> The tax exemption shall first apply in the year following the calendar year in which the certification is made to the County Auditor by the Housing Officer pursuant to subsection (e) hereof.

<P>(Ord. 915. Passed 12-4-80.)
