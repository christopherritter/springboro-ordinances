<H1>1028.33  WORK PERFORMED UNDER REVOCABLE STREET PRIVILEGE PERMITS.</H1>

<P>(a) Upon order of the City Engineer, all work which does not comply with the Revocable Street Privilege Permit, the approved plans and specifications for the work, or the requirements of this chapter, shall be removed.

<P>(b) The permit holder shall promptly complete all construction activities so as to minimize disruption of the public ways and other public and private property. All construction work authorized by a permit within the public ways, including restoration, must be completed in a time period established by the City Engineer.

<P>(c) Within sixty (60) days after completion of construction, the permit holder shall furnish the City with one (1) complete set of plans certified to the City as accurately depicting the location of all facilities constructed pursuant to the permit.

<P>(d) Upon completion of any construction work the permit holder shall, at its own expense, repair any and all public ways and restore property improvements, fixtures, structures and facilities, which were damaged during the course of construction, as nearly as practicable to their condition before the start of construction.

<P> (1) If weather or other conditions do not permit the complete restoration required by this section, the permit holder shall temporarily restore the affected public ways or property in accordance with standards established by the City. Such temporary restoration shall be at the permit holder's sole expense and the permit holder shall undertake and complete the required permanent restoration when the weather or other conditions no longer prevent such permanent restoration.

<P> (2) A permit holder or other person acting on its behalf shall use suitable barricades, flags, flagmen, lights, flares and other measures as necessary and in accordance with applicable state and local requirements for the safety of all members of the general public and to prevent injury or damage to any person, vehicle or property by reason of such work in or affecting such ways or property. 

<P> (3) If the permit holder fails to restore public property as required by this provision within thirty (30) days of completion of the construction work or as otherwise specified on the permit, the City may have such work performed at the sole expense of the Permit Holder. 

<P>(e) <U>Landscape Restoration</U>. All trees, landscaping and grounds removed, damaged or disturbed as a result of the construction, installation, maintenance, repair or replacement of facilities must be replaced or restored as nearly as may be practicable, to the condition existing prior to performance of work.

<P>  (1)  A Utility Service Provider must have a valid Certificate of Registration on file with the City, before the City may issue a Revocable Street Privilege Permit.

<P> (2) When practical, in the opinion of the City, the policy of the City is to require the underground location of a new Utility System element. 

<P> (3) The construction, demolition or removal of any element of a Utility System in a public Right of Way by a Utility Service Provider must be accomplished in a practical manner which, in the opinion of the City, results in the least potential amount of damage and disruption of the public Right of Way.

<P> (4) The applicant shall provide a specific timetable for the permit work to be accomplished within, detailed plans, accurate scale drawings, and specifications in sufficient detail acceptable to the City to describe the area of work covered in the permit application. In addition, the City may require the applicant to provide up-to-date, accurate, comprehensive master plans of the existing and proposed Utility System. These master plans are intended to allow the City to consider the broader context of the Utility Service Provider's plans upon which the permit application is based.

<P>  (Ord. 08-22. Passed 7-3-08.)
