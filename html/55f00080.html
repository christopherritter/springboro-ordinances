<P>(a)  Applications for any change of district boundaries or classifications of property as shown on the Official Zoning Map shall be submitted to the Planning Commission at its public office, upon such forms as the Commission provides, and shall be accompanied by such data and information as may be prescribed for that purpose by the Commission, so as to ensure the fullest practical presentation of facts for the permanent record. Each proposal for a zone change shall be accompanied by a reproducible vicinity map, at a scale approved by the Building and Zoning Inspector, showing the property lines, streets and existing and proposed zoning. Each such application shall be verified by at least one of the owners or lessees of property within the area proposed to be reclassified, attesting to the truth and correctness of all facts and information presented with the applications. Applications for amendments initiated by the Commission shall be accompanied by its motion pertaining to such proposed amendment. 

<P>(b)  The procedure for the amendment of this Zoning Code shall be as set forth in Ohio R.C. Chapter 713. (Ord. 546B. Passed 2-25-76.)
