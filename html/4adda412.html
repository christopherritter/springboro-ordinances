<H1>1246.06 DEFERRAL OF REQUIRED IMPROVEMENTS.</H1>

<P>(a) The Planning Commission may defer or waive at the time of record plan approval, subject to appropriate conditions, the provision of any or all public improvements as, in its judgment, are not requisite in the interests of the public health, safety, and general welfare, or which are inappropriate because of the inadequacy or inexistence of connecting facilities. Any determination to defer or waive the provision of any public improvement must be made on the record and the reasons for the deferral or waiver also shall be expressly made on the record.\

<P>(b) Whenever it is deemed necessary by the City to defer the construction of any improvement required under these regulations because of incompatible grades, future planning, inadequate or nonexistent connecting facilities, or for other reasons, the subdivider shall pay his share of the costs of the future improvements to the local government prior to signing of the record plans by the City, or the developer may execute a separate subdivision improvement agreement secured by a bond or cash escrow guaranteeing completion of the deferred improvements upon demand of the local government.

<P>(Ord. 04-41. Passed 8-19-04.)
