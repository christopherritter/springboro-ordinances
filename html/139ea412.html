<H1>Section 5.07 Initiative and Referendum.</H1>

<P>Except as otherwise provided by this Charter, legislative ordinances may be proposed, and legislative ordinances passed by the City Council may be challenged, by initiative and referendum following procedures set forth in the Ohio Revised Code. However, referendum shall not be applicable to emergency ordinances, resolutions, motions, ordinances implementing administrative actions, or ordinances making adjudicatory decisions. If the Council is required to pass more than one ordinance to complete and pay for any public improvement, initiative and referendum shall apply only to the first ordinance passed and not to any subsequent ordinance. Initiative and referendum petitions shall not be deemed filed with the City until a written receipt therefor, indicating the time and date of filing, has been issued by the Clerk of Council. 

<P>(Amended 11-4-08.)
