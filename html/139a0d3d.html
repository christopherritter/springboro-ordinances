<H1>Section 5.06 Adoption of Ordinances by Reference.</H1>

<P>The Council may adopt model or standard codes prepared and published by any public or private agency by reference to the date and source of the code without reproducing it at length in the ordinance. However, if the Council desires to modify, add to, or eliminate from any such code any section or part thereof, such addition, modification or omission shall be clearly stated in the ordinance. In all such cases in which such a code shall be adopted by reference, publication of the code at length, by the City, shall not be required. However, at least one copy of all such codes, including all amendments thereto, shall be kept in the office of the Clerk of Council for consultation by interested persons during regular office hours and additional copies shall be for sale, when available, at cost, by the Clerk of Council. (Amended 11-4-08.)
