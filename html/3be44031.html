<H1>826.25  ADMINISTRATIVE INTERPRETATIONS AND APPLICANT APPEALS.</H1>

<P>The primary responsibility and authority for interpretation of this chapter rests with the City Manager or his designee. When the City Manager or designee finds that any section of this chapter is unclear, or when any applicant for a sign permit or person directly and adversely affected by the issuance of such permit files an appeal disputing the interpretation of the City Manager or designee, the Board of Zoning Appeals shall hear relevant arguments on the question, and shall render a decision. The following principles shall be applied when making interpretations:

<P>(a) This chapter is generally written in permissive language. Signs not specifically and expressly identified, defined and permitted by this chapter are prohibited.

<P>(b) A sign will fall under at least one functional classification and at least one structural classification under the definitions of this chapter. Each sign must satisfy the regulations for all such classifications.

<P>(c) Where two regulations are in conflict, the more specific shall prevail. Where neither regulation is more specific, the more restrictive shall prevail.

<P>(d) Ambiguity should be resolved to maximize consistency among the provisions of the chapter, and effectuate their intent.

<P>Requests by the City Manager or designee to the Board of Zoning Appeals for interpretations, and appeals to the Board of Zoning Appeals of interpretations by the City Manager or designee from applicants or persons directly and adversely affected by the issuance of a permit, shall carry no fee.

<P>(Ord. 96-38. Passed 7-11-96.)
