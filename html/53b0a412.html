<H1>1272.12 EROSION AND SEDIMENTATION CONTROL.</H1>

  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY> Effective erosion and sedimentation controls shall be planned and applied according to the following principles: 

  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY> (a)  The smallest practical area of land should be exposed at any one time during development.

  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY> (b) When land is exposed during development, the exposure should be kept to the shortest practical period of time.

  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY> (c) Temporary vegetation and/or mulching shall be used to protect critical areas exposed during development.

  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY> (d) Sediment basins (debris basins or silt traps) shall be installed and maintained to remove sediment from run-off waters from land undergoing development.

  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY> (e) Provisions shall be made to accommodate the increased run-off caused by changed soil and surface conditions during and after development.

  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY> (f) Permanent final vegetation and structures shall be installed as soon as practical in the development. 

  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY> (g) The development shall be fitted to the topography and soils so as to create the least erosion potential.

  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY> (h) Wherever feasible, natural vegetation should be retained and protected. Development of the PUD must conform to the municipal tree ordinance.

  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>  (Ord. 02-4. Passed 1-17-02.)
