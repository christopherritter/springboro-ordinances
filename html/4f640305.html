  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY> (a) Each site development subject to Planning Commission review under Section <A HREF='54f1829c.html?f=FifLink&amp;t=document-frame.htm&amp;l=jump&amp;iid=2708dbda.33f0517e.0.0&amp;nid=c35#JD_Ch1280'>1280</A>, Site Plan Review, shall also be subject to review by the Architectural Review Board for compliance with the Town Center Design Standards, as they may be amended from time to time with Council approval.

  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY> (b) In its review of a proposed site development, the Architectural Review Board shall have the discretion to apply its expertise in assisting the applicant in achieving substantial compliance with the Town Center Design Standards, and in identifying acceptable alternatives when literal compliance with all standards may not be possible or desirable.

  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY> (c) Any alteration of a structure affecting less than thirty percent of its area, as measured by square footage of the floor space, or structure height, or of any elevation existing as of the date of enactment of Section 1264.19 (Ordinance O-01-4, passed January 18, 2001), or as of the date of approval of a site plan, shall be exempt from the Town Center Overlay Zoning District review set forth in Section 1264.19.
