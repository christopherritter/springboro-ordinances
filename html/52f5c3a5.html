<H1>1271.06 SOLAR ENERGY SYSTEMS.</H1>

  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY> (a) <U>Purpose.</U> This section is intended to establish regulations to balance the need for clean and renewable energy sources and the need to protect the public health, safety and welfare of the community and to ensure that solar energy systems are appropriately designed, installed and maintained within the City of Springboro. This section establishes the design and development criteria that allow solar energy systems to be located in the community on structures and property.

  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY> (b) <U>General Design and Development Standards for all Solar Energy Systems.</U> The following standards shall apply for all solar energy systems:

  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>  (1) Solar energy systems shall be located in the least visibly obtrusive location where they would be functional.

  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>  (2) Non-reflective coating shall be used to minimize glare.

  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>  (3) Panels and associated mounting hardware shall be uniform in appearance and color.

  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY> (c) <U>Design and Development Standards for Ground-Mounted Solar Energy Systems.</U> The following design and development standards shall apply for all ground-mounted solar energy systems:

  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>  (1) Ground-mounted solar energy systems shall conform to the accessory structure standards of the zoning district in which they are installed including (1) maximum height and (2) installation in side or rear yards only. Ground-mounted solar energy systems are prohibited in front yards.

  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>  (2) In addition, all ground-mounted solar energy system may not cover more than 25% of the side or rear yard in which they are installed.

  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>  (3) Ground-mounted solar systems shall be screened by means of fences, walls or landscaping.

  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>  (4) Ground-mounted solar energy systems shall be installed in a manner to prevent the negative impact of glare or reflection onto neighboring properties or rights-of-way.

  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY> (d) <U>Design and Development Standards for Building-Mounted Solar Energy Systems.</U> The following design and development standards shall apply for building-mounted solar energy systems:

  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>  (1) Roof-mounted solar energy systems shall be installed on the same plane of the roof material (flush mounted) or shall be made a part of the roof design.

  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>  (2) Roof-mounted solar energy systems shall not extend above the ridgeline of the roof to which they are attached and they may not extend below the roof line.

  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>  (3) Mounting brackets for roof-mounted solar energy systems shall not extend more than three inches (3&quot;) above the roof surface and shall be covered in a manner architecturally compatible with the building to which is attached to minimize visibility from the right-of-way or adjoining properties.

  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>  (4) All building-mounted solar energy systems shall be installed in a manner so they have a rectangular configuration.

  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>  (5) Wiring and other appurtenances associated with roof-mounted solar energy systems shall be installed in a manner not visible from the right-of-way or adjoining properties.

  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY> (e) <U>Approvals, Submission Requirements and Fees.</U>

  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>  (1) All solar energy systems shall be reviewed and approved by the Planning Commission under the provisions established in Chapter <A HREF='54f1829c.html?f=FifLink&amp;t=document-frame.htm&amp;l=jump&amp;iid=2708dbda.33f0517e.0.0&amp;nid=c35#JD_Ch1280'>1280</A>, Site Plan Review.

  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>  (2) The submission of an application for a permit shall be required for the placement of any solar energy system shall be submitted to the Director of Planning or their designee. The owner of the property on which the system is to be installed shall complete an application that includes a scaled site plan of the proposed solar energy system location(s); scale drawings indicating the size of the system components, a written description of the proposed system; materials and color; specification sheets; building elevations; and proposed screening information.

  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>  (3) Each person submitting an application for a permit under the provisions of this section shall pay a fee, as set forth in Appendix A of Chapter <A HREF='58d37b9c.html?f=FifLink&amp;t=document-frame.htm&amp;l=jump&amp;iid=2708dbda.33f0517e.0.0&amp;nid=83#JD_Ch1464'>1464</A> of the Codified Ordinances of the City of Springboro.

  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY> (f) <U>Other Provisions.</U>

  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>  (1) Obsolete solar energy systems shall be removed within three (3) months of becoming nonfunctional.

  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>  (2) The repair of solar energy systems installed and operating at the time of the adoption of this ordinance are exempt from these provisions provided there is no expansion of the area covered by the solar energy system.

  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>  (3) Solar energy systems mounted on a flat roof are exempt from the proposed review process solar energy systems installed on flat roofs (1) where the installation is not visible from the right-of-way or adjacent properties, (2) the installation does not exceed zoning district height restrictions, and (3) the installation does not produce glare for adjacent properties or the right-of-way.

  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>  (4) Solar energy systems having a surface area of one (1) square foot or less that are attached to a light fixture or similar appurtenance to provide electrical power to said fixture or appurtenance are exempt from these provisions. No more than one (1) such system may be located on a lot.

  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>   (Ord. 12-37. Passed 8-16-12.)
