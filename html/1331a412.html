<P>The powers of the City under this Charter shall be construed liberally in favor of the Charter and the City, and the enumeration of particular and specific powers in the Charter shall not be construed as limiting in any way the general power to which this government is entitled under the Constitution and laws of the State of Ohio. As used in this Charter, unless the context otherwise requires, the singular includes the plural and the plural includes the singular; words of one gender include the other gender; and words in the present tense include the future. (Amended 11-4-08.)
