<H1>1224.06  CRITERIA FOR ESTABLISHMENT OF AREAS.</H1>

<P>Criteria have been established to identify possible areas to be designated for community reinvestment and to evaluate the nature and the amount of the benefit to be gained by the Municipality if tax abatement is made available under the community reinvestment program. It is anticipated that this authority will be used carefully by Council and will be restricted to those cases which will provide a substantial benefit for a long period of time.

<P>As a consequence, the deliberations leading to the creation of a community reinvestment area will be thorough. Since each candidate area and each applicant will have varying conditions unique to its particular circumstances, the following criteria are selected as a check list and to structure the deliberations. Such criteria are not intended to be used as a weighted scoring mechanism. It is conceivable that under certain circumstances a strongly adverse, single condition may be a sufficient reason for not designating a certain area or for not offering tax abatement to a certain applicant. On the other hand, only two or three strongly favorable circumstances may weigh heavily enough to properly merit the establishment of an area or the offer of abatement to an applicant.

<P>In the following lists of criteria, groupings are solely to facilitate the collection and analysis of information by subject areas, in an orderly fashion. Relative positions of individual items in the list do not connote either priority consideration or relative importance.
