<H1>402.12  EXPLOSIVES.</H1>

<P>&quot;Explosives&quot; means any chemical compound or mechanical mixture that is intended for the purpose of producing an explosion that contains any oxidizing and combustible units or other ingredients in such proportions, quantities or packing that an ignition by fire, by friction, by concussion, by percussion or by a detonator of any part of the compound or mixture may cause such a sudden generation of highly heated gases that the resultant gaseous pressures are capable of producing destructive effects on contiguous objects, or of destroying life or limb.

<P>Manufactured articles shall not be held to be explosives when the individual units contain explosives in such limited quantities, of such nature or in such packing, that it is impossible to procure a simultaneous or a destructive explosion of such units, to the injury of life, limb or property by fire, by friction, by concussion, by percussion or by a detonator, such as fixed ammunition for small arms, firecrackers or safety fuse matches.
