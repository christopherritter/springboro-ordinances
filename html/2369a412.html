  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY> (a) The driver of any vehicle involved in an accident resulting in damage to real property, or personal property attached to real property, legally upon or adjacent to a public road or highway immediately shall stop and take reasonable steps to locate and notify the owner or person in charge of the property of that fact, of the driver’s name and address, and of the registration number of the vehicle the driver is driving and, upon request and if available, shall exhibit the driver’s or commercial driver’s license.

  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY> If the owner or person in charge of the property cannot be located after reasonable search, the driver of the vehicle involved in the accident resulting in damage to the property, within twenty-four hours after the accident, shall forward to the police authority in the municipality in which the accident or collision occurred, the same information required to be given to the owner or person in control of the property and give the location of the accident and a description of the damage insofar as it is known.

  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY> (b) Whoever violates subsection (a) of this section is guilty of failure to stop after an accident involving the property of others, a misdemeanor of the first degree.
