  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY> (d)  The unpaid principal amount of the deferred fee may be prepaid in full at any time at the option of the property owner, without penalty, and upon prepayment in full, all interest charges, as provided in subsection (e) hereof shall cease. 

  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY> (e)  Interest on the outstanding principal amount of the deferred fee shall be computed at the lower of the rate of ten and one-half percent per year, or a rate equal to the average prime rate charged by the banks located in the Municipality, provided that the interest shall be determined at the time of the filing of the agreement provided for in this section and such rate of interest shall not be altered for the life of the agreement.
