<H1>1266.04 REPLACEMENT OF ORIGINAL MAP. </H1>

<P>If the Official Zoning Map becomes damaged, destroyed, lost or difficult to interpret because of the nature or number of changes and additions or for any other reason a new Map may be prepared which shall supersede the prior Map. The new Map may correct drafting or other errors or omissions in the prior Map, but no such correction thereof shall have the effect of amending the original Map or any subsequent amendment thereof. The new Map shall be authenticated by the signature of the Mayor, attested by the Clerk of Council, and include the following certification: “This is to certify that this Official Zoning Map supersedes and replaces the Official Zoning Map originally adopted (date), as part of Ordinance Number (number), the same being codified as Section <A HREF="50515abe.html">1266.01</A> of the Codified Ordinances of the Municipality of Springboro, Ohio”. No action of the City Council shall be required to approve a replacement map which complies with this section, nor shall Council approval be required for its execution by the Mayor and Clerk of Council. (Ord. 01-13. Passed 3-15-01.)
