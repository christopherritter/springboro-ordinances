  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY> (a)  Except as limited or directed by this Charter, all powers of the City not inconsistent with this Charter shall be vested in a Council which shall have power to legislate under the authority of this Charter and to enact all ordinances and resolutions necessary and proper for carrying into execution the purposes of this Charter. Council shall consist of seven (7) Council Members, of which six (6) shall be Council Members elected for overlapping terms, as modified by Section <A HREF='14bb022d.html?f=FifLink&amp;t=document-frame.htm&amp;l=jump&amp;iid=2708dbda.33f0517e.0.0&amp;nid=1ff#JD_1303'>13.03</A>, and one (1) shall be separately elected as Mayor as provided by Sections <A HREF='1346a0c0.html?f=FifLink&amp;t=document-frame.htm&amp;l=jump&amp;iid=2708dbda.33f0517e.0.0&amp;nid=2c1#JD_403'>4.03</A> and <A HREF='14bf98c3.html?f=FifLink&amp;t=document-frame.htm&amp;l=jump&amp;iid=2708dbda.33f0517e.0.0&amp;nid=201#JD_1304'>13.04</A>.

  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY> (b)  Two (2) Council Members and the Mayor will be elected at large for a four (4)-year term of office and every four (4) years thereafter. Two (2) years later, and every four (4) years thereafter, four (4) Council Members will be elected from wards for a four (4)-year term of office. Within six (6) months after the adoption of this Charter, Council shall divide the City into four (4) wards for purposes of electing ward Council Members. Within one (1) year following receipt of each Federal decennial census information, or at any other time when necessary to achieve substantially equal population in each ward, the Council will redivide the City into four (4) wards of substantially equal population.

  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY> (c)  The regular term of Council Members and the Mayor shall begin the first day of January following their election. Each shall take the oath of office after certification of election by the Board of Elections, but prior to the first day of January following their election. They will serve until their successors are chosen and are qualified as such. If a Council Member-elect fails to qualify, or dies, or resigns, the position shall be filled according to the provisions of this Charter for vacancies in Council. All elections of Council Members and the Mayor shall be on a nonpartisan basis. (Amended 11-4-08.)
