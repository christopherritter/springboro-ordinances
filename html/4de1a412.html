<H1>1264.02  A-1 AGRICULTURAL DISTRICT. </H1>

<P>(a)  The purpose of the A-1 District is to provide land which is suitable or used for agricultural, conservation, very low density residential, public and quasipublic purposes. Very low density residential land use refers to farm housing units and isolated residential developments not requiring a plat under the Subdivision Regulations. It is further the purpose of the A-1 District to discourage the scattering of residential subdivisions and commercial or industrial development. On-site water and sewer facilities are permitted, provided such facilities comply with the County health regulations. 

<P>(Ord. 546B. Passed 2-25-76.) 

<P>(b)  Nothing contained in this section shall prohibit the use of any land, five acres or more, for agricultural purposes or the construction or use of any building or structure incidental to such agricultural use, and no zoning certificate shall be required for any such agricultural use, building or structure so long as any building or structure used to house farm animals or poultry is located at least 100 feet from residentially zoned and developed land. 

<P>(Ord. 660. Passed 8-18-77.)
