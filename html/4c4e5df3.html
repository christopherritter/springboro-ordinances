The public hearing shall take place no less than thirty (30) days after the published notice.

<P> (2) <U>Criteria.</U> The City Council shall approve the petition for vacation on such terms and conditions as are reasonable to protect public health, safety and welfare; but in no event may the City Council approve a petition for vacation if it will materially injure the rights of any non-consenting property owner or any public rights in public improvements unless expressly agreed to by the governing body.

<P>(b) <U>Government Initiated Record Plan Vacation</U>.

<P> (1) <U>General conditions</U>. The City Council, on its motion, may vacate the record plan of an approved subdivision when:
