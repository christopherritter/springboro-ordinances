<H1>820.09 APPEAL AND REVIEW. </H1>

<P>If an applicant has been denied a license, or if his or her license has been revoked or suspended, the applicant or licensee, as the case may be, shall, within three business days, have the right to appeal to Council from such denial, revocation or suspension. Notice of appeal shall be filed in writing with the Chief of Police who shall fix the time and place for hearing, the same to be not later than one week thereafter. The Chief shall notify the Manager and all members of Council of the time and place of such hearing not less than twelve hours in advance thereof. Three members of Council shall constitute a quorum to hear such appeal. The appellant may appear and be heard in person or by counsel. If, after hearing, a majority of the members of Council present at such meeting declare in favor of the applicant, such license shall be forthwith issued or fully reinstated, as the case may be; otherwise, the order appealed from shall become final.
