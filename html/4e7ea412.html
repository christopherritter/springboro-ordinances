<H1>1264.10 B-4 DESTINATION BUSINESS DISTRICT. </H1>

<P>(a)  <U>Purposes</U>. The purpose of the B-4 District is to reserve land for commercial uses which attract a regional clientele because of the quantity, quality, variety or specialized nature of the goods or services offered. These uses are often large in scale, or occupy a portion of a multiple occupancy complex which includes large-scale &quot;anchor&quot; uses. Thus these uses are typically associated with large-scale development and high traffic volumes. A secondary purpose of the district is to reserve additional land for those uses permitted in the B-1 Highway Business District. 

<P>(b)  <U>Permitted Uses</U>. Only the following uses shall be permitted, subject to Site Plan Review pursuant to Chapter <A HREF="54f1829c.html">1280</A> and all other municipal ordinances, regulations and state and federal laws: 

<P> (1)  All uses permitted in the B-1 Highway Business District, without limitation as to floor area. 

<P> (2)  Hotels, motels, lodging houses, dormitories, conference centers. 

<P> (3)  Theaters without limitation as to the number of stages or screens.

<P> (4)  Cemetery monument sales.

<P> (5) Other similar uses as determined by the Zoning Inspector or Board of Zoning Appeals.

<P>(c)  <U>Certain Facilities Permitted</U>. Those facilities expressly permitted under subsection (c) of Section <A HREF="4e266f74.html">1264.07</A>, B-1 Highway Business District, are permitted to the same extent in this district. 

<P>(Ord. 00-15. Passed 2-17-00.)
