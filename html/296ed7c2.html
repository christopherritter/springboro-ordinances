<H1>606.07  REQUIREMENTS FOR CRIMINAL LIABILITY.</H1>

<P>(a) Except as provided in subsection (b) hereof, a person is not guilty of an offense unless both of the following apply:

<P> (1) The person’s liability is based on conduct that includes either a voluntary act, or an omission to perform an act or duty that the person is capable of performing;

<P> (2) The person has the requisite degree of culpability for each element as to which a culpable mental state is specified by the section defining the offense.

<P>(b) When the section defining an offense does not specify any degree of culpability, and plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict criminal liability for the conduct described in the section, then culpability is not required for a person to be guilty of the offense. When the section neither specifies culpability nor plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict liability, recklessness is sufficient culpability to commit the offense.

<P>(c) Voluntary intoxication may not be taken into consideration in determining the existence of a mental state that is an element of a criminal offense. Voluntary intoxication does not relieve a person of a duty to act if failure to act constitutes a criminal offense. Evidence that a person was voluntarily intoxicated may be admissible to show whether or not the person was physically capable of performing the act with which the person is charged.

<P>(d) As used in this section:

<P> (1) Possession is a voluntary act if the possessor knowingly procured or received the thing possessed, or was aware of the possessor’s control of the thing possessed for a sufficient time to have ended possession.

<P> (2) Reflexes, convulsions, body movements during unconsciousness or sleep, and body movements that are not otherwise a product of the actor's volition, are involuntary acts.

<P> (3) &quot;Culpability&quot; means purpose, knowledge, recklessness or negligence, as defined in Section<A HREF="292aa73d.html"> 606.02</A>.

<P> (4) “Intoxication” includes, but is not limited to, intoxication resulting from the ingestion of alcohol, a drug, or alcohol and a drug. 

<P>  (ORC 2901.21)
