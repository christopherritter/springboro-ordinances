<H1>698.05 MULTIPLE SENTENCES. </H1>

  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY> (a)  Except as provided in subsection (b) hereof, a sentence of imprisonment shall be served concurrently with any other sentence of imprisonment imposed by a court of this Municipality, the State, another state, or the United Slates. In any case, a sentence of imprisonment for misdemeanor shall be served concurrently with a sentence of imprisonment for felony served in a State or Federal penal or reformatory institution. 

  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY> (b)  A sentence of imprisonment shall be served consecutively to any other sentence of imprisonment when the trial court specifies that it is to be served consecutively. 

  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY> (c)  Subject to the maximum provided in subsection (d) hereof, when consecutive sentences of imprisonment are imposed for misdemeanor, the term to be served is the aggregate of the consecutive terms imposed. 

  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY> (d)  Consecutive terms of imprisonment imposed shall not exceed an aggregate term of eighteen months, when the consecutive terms imposed are for misdemeanors. When consecutive terms aggregating more than one year are imposed for misdemeanors under the Ohio Revised Code or these Codified Ordinances, and at least one such consecutive term is for a misdemeanor of the first degree that is an offense of violence, the trial court may order the aggregate term imposed to be served in a State penal or reformatory institution.
