<H1>1272.25 PHASING.</H1>

<P>(a) The establishment of common open spaces and the construction of public or common residential facilities shown on the recorded final development plan, together with the construction of other nonresidential structures, shall proceed substantially in accordance with the phasing program submitted pursuant to Section <A HREF="53cef663.html">1272.16</A>(d)(4). 

<P>(b) After general construction commences, the developer shall submit progress reports every six (6) months to the Planning Commission which shall review all building permits issued and compare them to the overall development phasing program. If it is determined that the rate or sequence of construction of the PUD substantially differs from the phasing program, the Commission shall so notify the developer in writing. Thereafter, the Commission may issue such orders to the developer as it sees fit, and, upon continued violation of this section, may suspend the developer from further construction of dwelling units or nonresidential structures until compliance is achieved. (Ord. 02-4. Passed 1-17-02.)
