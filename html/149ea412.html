<P>(a) <U>Submission. </U> Any provisions of this Charter may be amended as provided in Article XVIII, Section 9, of the Ohio Constitution, by submission of a proposed amendment to the electors of the City and approval by a majority of those voting on the question of its adoption. Such amendment may be initiated either by a vote of at least five (5) members of Council, or by petition to the Council signed by ten (10) percent of the electors registered to vote at the last regular City election held in the City.

<P>(b)  <U>Review</U>. At the first meeting of the Council in January, 1984, and every eight (8) years thereafter, Council shall appoint a Commission of nine (9) electors of the City. It shall be the duty of the Commission to review the existing Charter and make such recommendations as it may see fit for revision. The Commission shall submit its report to Council not later than July 1 of the same year. Thereupon, the Council may take such action as it deems warranted with respect to such recommendations. 

<P>(c)  <U>Conflicting Amendments</U>. In the event two (2) conflicting amendments to the Charter are approved at the same election by a majority of the total number of votes cast, the one receiving the highest number of affirmative votes shall be the amendment to the Charter. (Amended 11-4-08.)
