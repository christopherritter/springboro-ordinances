<H1>1444.04  APPEALS. </H1>

<P>(a)  Within sixty days after receipt or after the last publication of the notice made pursuant to Section <A HREF="573e5bd5.html">1444.03</A>, the owner of the building, dwelling or structure may appeal, in writing, to Council, the finding by the Building and Zoning Inspector that such building, dwelling or structure is in such an advanced state of disrepair as to endanger the health, safety and welfare of the public. 

<P>(b)  Upon receipt of the written appeal, Council shall set the matter down for hearing within thirty days after receiving notice of appeal and the owner shall have an opportunity to appear before Council and to present evidence that the building, dwelling or structure is not in such an advanced state of disrepair, for any of the reasons set forth in Section <A HREF="573e5bd5.html">1444.03</A>, as to endanger the health, safety and welfare of the public and, therefore, is not a public nuisance. 

<P>(c)  If no appeal is filed from the finding of the Inspector within such sixty-day period, or if Council affirms the finding of the Inspector and determines that the building, dwelling or structure involved is a public nuisance, Council shall order the Clerk of Council to advertise for bids for the demolition and removal of the building, dwelling or structure in accordance with law, unless the owner has repaired the same in accordance with requirements of this Building and Housing Code. 

<P>(d)  If Council is apprised that the owner has appealed its decision to the Common Pleas Court or any other court having jurisdiction of such an appeal, the matter will be held in abeyance until further order of the court. (Ord. 649. Passed 6-16-77.)
