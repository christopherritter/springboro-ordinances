Such a submission shall include appropriate supporting documentation made in writing by the Mayor of City of Springboro, and may be submitted at any time.

  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>  (3) <U>Annexation / Detachment</U>. Upon occurrence, the Floodplain Administrator shall notify FEMA in writing whenever the boundaries of the City of Springboro have been modified by annexation or the community has assumed authority over an area, or no longer has authority to adopt and enforce floodplain management regulations for a particular area. In order that the City of Springboro Flood Insurance Rate Map accurately represent the City of Springboro boundaries, include within such notification a copy of a map of the City of Springboro suitable for reproduction, clearly showing the new corporate limits or the new area for which the City of Springboro has assumed or relinquished floodplain management regulatory authority.

  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY> (k) <U>Data Use and Flood Map Interpretation</U>. The following guidelines shall apply to the use and interpretation of maps and other data showing areas of special flood hazard:

  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>  (1) In areas where FEMA has not identified special flood hazard areas, or in FEMA identified special flood hazard areas where base flood elevation and floodway data have not been identified, the Floodplain Administrator shall review and reasonably utilize any other flood hazard data available from a federal, state, or other source.

  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>  (2) Base flood elevations and floodway boundaries produced on FEMA flood maps and studies shall take precedence over base flood elevations and floodway boundaries by any other source that reflect a reduced floodway width and/or lower base flood elevations. Other sources of data, showing increased base flood elevations and/or larger floodway areas than are shown on FEMA flood maps and studies, shall be reasonably used by the Floodplain Administrator.

  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>  (3) When Preliminary Flood Insurance Rate Maps and / or Flood Insurance Study have been provided by FEMA:

  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>   A. Upon the issuance of a Letter of Final Determination by the FEMA, the preliminary flood hazard data shall be used and replace all previously existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA for the purposes of administering these regulations. 

  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>   B. Prior to the issuance of a Letter of Final Determination by FEMA, the use of preliminary flood hazard data shall only be required where no base flood elevations and /or floodway areas exist or where the preliminary base flood elevations or floodway area exceed the base flood elevations and/or floodway widths in existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA. Such preliminary data may be subject to change and / or appeal to FEMA.

  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>  (4) The Floodplain Administrator shall make interpretations, where needed, as to the exact location of the flood boundaries and areas of special flood hazard. A person contesting the determination of the location of the boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation as provided in Section <A HREF='586aa3ab.html?f=FifLink&amp;t=document-frame.htm&amp;l=jump&amp;iid=2708dbda.33f0517e.0.0&amp;nid=49b#JD_144805'>1448.05</A>, Appeals and Variances.

  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>  (5) Where a map boundary showing an area of special flood hazard and field elevations disagree, the base flood elevations or flood protection elevations (as found on an elevation profile, floodway data table, established high water marks, <I>etc.</I>) shall prevail.

  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY> (l) <U>Substantial Damage Determinations</U>. Damages to structures may result from a variety of causes including flood, tornado, wind, heavy snow, fire, <I>etc.</I> After such a damage event, the Floodplain Administrator shall:

  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>  (1) Determine whether damaged structures are located in special flood hazard areas;

  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>  (2) Conduct substantial damage determinations for damaged structures located in special flood hazard areas; and

  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>  (3) Make reasonable attempt to notify owners of substantially damaged structures of the need to obtain a floodplain development permit prior to repair, rehabilitation, or reconstruction.

  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY> Additionally, the Floodplain Administrator may implement other measures to assist with the substantial damage determination and subsequent repair process. These measures include issuing press releases, public service announcements, and other public information materials related to the floodplain development permits and repair of damaged structures; coordinating with other federal, state, and local agencies to assist with substantial damage determinations; providing owners of damaged structures materials and other information related to the proper repair of damaged structures in special flood hazard areas; and assist owners of substantially damaged structures with Increased Cost of Compliance insurance claims.
