<H1>1266.06  INTERPRETATION OF DISTRICT BOUNDARIES. </H1>

<P>Where uncertainty exists with respect to the boundaries of any of the zoning districts as shown on the Official Zoning Map, the following rules shall apply: 

<P>(a)  Where district boundaries are indicated as approximately following the centerlines of streets or highways, street lines or highway right-of-way lines, such center lines, street lines or highway right-of-way lines shall be construed to be such boundaries.

<P>(b)  Where district boundaries are so indicated that they approximately follow lot lines, such lot lines shall be construed to be such boundaries. 

<P>(c)  Where district boundaries are so indicated that they are approximately parallel to the centerlines or street lines of streets, or the centerlines or right-of-way lines of highways, such district boundaries shall be construed as being parallel thereto and at such distance therefrom as indicated on the Map. If no distance is given, such dimension shall be determined by the use of the scale shown on the Map.

<P>(d)  Where the boundary of a district follows a railroad line, such boundary shall be deemed to be located in the middle of the main tracks of such railroad line. 

<P>(e)  Where the boundary of a district follows a stream, lake or other body of water, such boundary line shall be deemed to be at the limit of the jurisdiction of the Municipality, unless otherwise indicated. 

<P>(f) Where the location of the boundary of district cannot reasonably be determined by application of the above methods, the City Council shall have authority to make the determination after recommendation by the Planning Commission, notice to property owners and a hearing, all as in a rezoning.

<P> (Ord. 01-13. Passed 3-15-01.)
