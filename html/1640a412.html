<P>  (a) <U>Regular meetings.</U> Regular meetings of Council shall be held in the Council chambers in the Municipal Building on the first and third Thursdays of each month at 7:00 p.m., except that when any such Thursday is a legal holiday, or when for other good and sufficient reason it is impractical to hold a regularly scheduled meeting, Council shall meet in regular session on a day and at a time established by a majority vote of Council.

<P>  (b) <U>Special meetings.</U> Special meetings may be called by four or more members of Council, by the Mayor or by the Manager. When sufficient time before the hour of meeting permits, the Clerk shall prepare a notice of the special session, its starting time and place and the subject of the session. Such notice shall be served personally upon each member of Council and the Manager, or left at their usual places of residence at least twenty-four hours before the time of the meeting. The Clerk shall make a diligent effort to notify each member in person, either by telephone or otherwise, of such special notice. Only the matter set forth in the notice of the meeting shall be discussed at such meeting.

<P>  (c) <U>Adjourned meetings.</U> A session of Council may be continued or adjourned from day to day, or for more than one day, but no adjournment shall be for a longer period than the next regular meeting thereafter. An absent member shall be notified personally by telephone or by written notice serviced personally, at his or her regular place of residence, at least twenty-four hours prior to the date and hours of the reconvened adjourned meeting.

<P>  (d) <U>Executive sessions.</U>

<P>   (1) An executive session of Council shall be convened upon a majority vote of Council. The Mayor, any member of Council or the Manager may request that an executive session be held.

<P>   (2) Attendance at the executive session shall be limited to the Mayor, members of Council, the Clerk of Council, and the Manager, provided, however, that the Mayor and Council may invite such persons as may be required for advice and information, and at their discretion, may exclude anyone.

<P>   (3) Executive sessions shall be held for the sole purpose of consideration of the following matters, as defined more specifically in Ohio R.C. 121.22:

<P>    A. Personnel matters, with respect to specific Municipal employees, officials or licensees;

<P>    B. The purchase or sale of property;

<P>RULE 5. <U>Quorum</U>. A majority of the members elected shall constitute a quorum at all meetings.

<P>RULE 6. <U>Agenda.</U> For the purpose of receiving legislation, and for the purpose of receiving public input for the agenda content, the agenda shall be closed at noon on the Friday preceding the scheduled meeting. Any item to be placed on the agenda must be in the office of the Manager and/or the Clerk of Council prior to the above time. Items to be included on the agenda, and all reports, communications, etc., to be submitted to Council, shall be transmitted by the Clerk of Council with Manager approval, to the Police Division, or other method as designated by the Manager, for delivery to each Council member at least forty-eight hours prior to the time of the meeting. The Clerk shall make available, at his or her office, copies of the agenda and pertinent background information to the members of the press.

<P>RULE 7. <U>Order and Decorum.</U> The Presiding Officer shall preserve decorum and decide all questions of order, subject to the appeal of Council.

<P>  (a) During Council meetings, members shall preserve order and decorum and shall not, either by conversation or otherwise, delay or interrupt the proceedings or refuse to obey the orders of the Presiding Officer or the rules of Council.

<P>  (b) Municipal employees shall observe the same rules of procedure and decorum applicable to the members of Council. While the Presiding Officer has the authority to preserve decorum in meetings so far as staff members and Municipal employees are concerned, the Manager shall also be responsible for the orderly conduct and decorum of all Municipal employees under his or her direction and control.

<P>  (c) Members of the public attending Council meetings shall also observe the same rules of propriety, decorum and good conduct applicable to members of Council. Any person who makes personal, impertinent or slanderous remarks, or who becomes boisterous while addressing Council or while attending a Council meeting, shall be removed from the room as directed by the Presiding Officer. Such person shall be barred from further audience before Council. Any member of the public wishing to address Council shall be recognized by the Chair, shall state his or her name and address in an audible tone for the record and shall limit his or her remarks to the question under discussion.

<P>RULE 8. <U>Clerk.</U> The Clerk shall keep the minutes of the meeting and shall perform such other duties in the meeting as may be required by Council.

<P>RULE 9. <U>Law Director.</U> The Law Director shall attend meetings of Council by request. Any member of Council may, at any time, call upon the Law Director for an oral or written opinion to decide any question of law, but not to decide upon any parliamentary rules. However, should the question to be decided require, in the opinion of the Law Director, study or investigation, he or she may defer such opinion for a reasonable time.

<P>RULE 10. <U>Manager.</U> The Manager shall attend all meetings of Council. The Manager shall have the right to participate in the discussion of all matters coming before Council, but shall have no vote. The Manager shall perform such other duties, not inconsistent with <A HREF="13b7f2f2.html">Article VI</A> of the Municipal Charter and the Ohio Revised Code, as may be requested by Council.

<P>  (b) Special committees for particular purposes may be appointed by Council at any time. Unless otherwise stated in the minutes relative to the appointment of a special committee, all such committees shall serve for the remainder of the year in which they are appointed, pursuant to <A HREF="14414401.html">Article IX</A> of the Municipal Charter.

Any member of Council may second such a motion.

If such appeal is seconded, the Presiding Officer shall state clearly the question at issue and his or her reason for the decision, if he or she thinks it necessary, and then state the question as follows: “The question is, ‘Shall the decision of the Chair be sustained?’” If a majority vote yes, the ruling of the Presiding Officer is sustained. Otherwise, the Presiding Officer is overruled.
