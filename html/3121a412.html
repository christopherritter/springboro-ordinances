  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY> (a) No person, who is the parent, guardian, custodian, person having custody or control, or person in loco parentis of a child under eighteen years of age or a mentally or physically handicapped child under twenty-one years of age, shall create a substantial risk to the health or safety of the child, by violating a duty of care, protection or support. It is not a violation of a duty of care, protection or support under this subsection when the parent, guardian, custodian or person having custody or control of a child treats the physical or mental illness or defect of the child by spiritual means through prayer alone, in accordance with the tenets of a recognized religious body.

  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY> (b) No person shall abuse a child under eighteen years of age or a mentally or physically handicapped child under twenty-one years of age.

  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY> (c) (1) No person shall operate a vehicle in violation of Section <A HREF='209cd826.html?f=FifLink&amp;t=document-frame.htm&amp;l=jump&amp;iid=2708dbda.33f0517e.0.0&amp;nid=29d#JD_43401'>434.01</A>(a) of the Traffic Code when one or more children under eighteen years of age are in the vehicle. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, a person may be convicted at the same trial or proceeding of a violation of subsection (c) hereof and a violation of Section <A HREF='209cd826.html?f=FifLink&amp;t=document-frame.htm&amp;l=jump&amp;iid=2708dbda.33f0517e.0.0&amp;nid=29d#JD_43401'>434.01</A>(a) of the Traffic Code that constitutes the basis of the charge of the violation of subsection (c) hereof. For purposes of Ohio R.C. 4511.191 to 4511.197 and all related provisions of law, a person arrested for a violation of subsection (c) hereof shall be considered to be under arrest for operating a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol, a drug of abuse, or a combination of them or for operating a vehicle with a prohibited concentration of alcohol in the whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine.

  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY> (d) Whoever violates this section is guilty of endangering children.

  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>  (1) Whoever violates subsection (a) or (b) hereof is guilty of a misdemeanor of the first degree.

The violation results in serious physical harm to the child involved and the offender previously has been convicted of a violation of Ohio R.C. 2919.22(C) or subsection (c) hereof, Ohio R.C. 2903.06, or 2903.08, Section 2903.07 as it existed prior to March 23, 2000, or Ohio R.C. 2903.04 in a case in which the offender was subject to the sanctions described in division (D) of that section.

  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>  (3) In addition to any term of imprisonment, fine, or other sentence, penalty, or sanction it imposes upon the offender pursuant to subsection (d)(2) hereof, or pursuant to any other provision of law, the court also may impose upon the offender any of the sanctions provided under Ohio R.C. 2919.22(E)(5)(d).
