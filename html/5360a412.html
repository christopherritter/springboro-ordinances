<H1>1272.03 PERMITTED USES; CATEGORIES OF PUDS .</H1>

  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY> An application for PUD zoning shall specify the land use category being requested. An application may specify areas proposed to be developed under different PUD categories or under combinations of PUD categories and conventional zoning. Once PUD zoning is approved, land uses are limited by two factors: 1) the PUD category for which application was made, and 2) the authority and discretion of the Planning Commission, in its approval of the General Plan and/or Final Development Plan, to determine which of the allowable uses in the category may be permitted, in what intensity and location, and under what conditions. PUDs may be applied for under any of the following land use categories: 

  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY> (a)  Planned Unit Development-Business (PUD-B) may allow any permitted use in any Business Zoning District; 

  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY> (b)  Planned Unit Development-Manufacturing (PUD-M) may allow any permitted use in any Manufacturing Zoning District; 

  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY> (c)  Planned Unit Development-Office (PUD-O) may allow any permitted use in any Office Zoning District; 

  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY> (d)  Planned Unit Development-Residential (PUD-R) may allow any permitted use in any Residential Zoning District; and 

  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY> (e)  Planned Unit Development-Mixed Use (POD-MU) may allow any combination of any permitted use in any Business, Manufacturing, Office, or Residential Zoning District as defined in Section <A HREF='533c47b3.html?f=FifLink&amp;t=document-frame.htm&amp;l=jump&amp;iid=2708dbda.33f0517e.0.0&amp;nid=71d#JD_127202'>1272.02. </A>

  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>  (Ord. 02-4. Passed 1-17-02.)
