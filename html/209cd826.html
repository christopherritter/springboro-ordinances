<P>  B. In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a violation of subsection (a) or (b) of this section or for an equivalent offense that is vehicle related, the court may admit evidence on the concentration of alcohol, drugs of abuse, controlled substances, metabolites of a controlled substance, or a combination of them in the defendant’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, urine or other bodily substance at the time of the alleged violation as shown by chemical analysis of the substance withdrawn within three hours of the time of the alleged violation. The three-hour time limit specified in this subsection regarding the admission of evidence does not extend or affect the two-hour time limit specified in Ohio R.C. 4511.192(A) as the maximum period of time during which a person may consent to a chemical test or tests as described in that section.

<P>The court may admit evidence on the concentration of alcohol, drugs of abuse, or a combination of them as described in this section when a person submits to a blood, breath, urine or other bodily substance test at the request of a law enforcement officer under Ohio R.C. 4511.191, or a blood or urine sample is obtained pursuant to a search warrant. Only a physician, a registered nurse, an emergency medical technician-intermediate, an emergency medical technician-paramedic or a qualified technician, chemist, or phlebotomist shall withdraw a blood sample for the purpose of determining the alcohol, drug, controlled substance, metabolite of a controlled substance, or combination content of the whole blood, blood serum, or blood plasma. This limitation does not apply to the taking of breath or urine specimens. A person authorized to withdraw blood under this subsection may refuse to withdraw blood under this subsection, if in that person’s opinion, the physical welfare of the person would be endangered by the withdrawing of blood.

<P> (2) In a criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for violation of subsection (a) of this section or for an equivalent offense that is vehicle related, if there was at the time the bodily substance was withdrawn a concentration of less than the applicable concentration of alcohol specified in subsections (a)(1)B., C., D. and E. of this section, or less than the applicable concentration of a listed controlled substance or a listed metabolite of a controlled substance specified for a violation of subsection (a)(1)J. of this section, that fact may be considered with other competent evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant. This subsection does not limit or affect a criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a violation of subsection (b) of this section or for an equivalent offense that is substantially equivalent to that subsection.

<P> (3) Upon the request of the person who was tested, the results of the chemical test shall be made available to the person or the person’s attorney, immediately upon the completion of the chemical test analysis.

<P>If the chemical test was obtained pursuant to subsection (e)(1)B. hereof, the person tested may have a physician, a registered nurse, or a qualified technician, chemist or phlebotomist of the person’s own choosing administer a chemical test or tests, at the person’s expense, in addition to any administered at the request of a law enforcement officer. If the person was under arrest as described in division (A)(5) of Ohio R.C. 4511.191, the arresting officer shall advise the person at the time of the arrest that the person may have an independent chemical test taken at the person’s own expense. If the person was under arrest other than described in division (A)(5) of Ohio R.C. 4511.191, the form to be read to the person to be tested, as required under Ohio R.C. 4511.192, shall state that the person may have an independent test performed at the person’s expense. The failure or inability to obtain an additional chemical test by a person shall not preclude the admission of evidence relating to the chemical test or tests taken at the request of a law enforcement officer.

<P> (4) A. As used in subsections (e)(4)B. and C. of this section, “national highway traffic safety administration” means the National Traffic Highway Safety Administration established as an administration of the United States Department of Transportation under 96 Stat. 2415 (1983), 49 U.S.C.A. 105.

<P>  B. In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a violation of subsection (a), (b) or (d) of this section, of a municipal ordinance relating to operating a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol, a drug of abuse, or alcohol and a drug of abuse, or of a municipal ordinance relating to operating a vehicle with a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the whole blood, blood serum or plasma,

<P>breath or urine, if a law enforcement officer has administered a field sobriety test to the operator or person in physical control of the vehicle involved in the violation and if it is shown by clear and convincing evidence that the officer administered the test in substantial compliance with the testing standards for any reliable, credible, and generally accepted field sobriety tests that were in effect at the time the tests were administered, including, but not limited to, any testing standards then in effect that were set by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, all of the following apply:

<P>  C. Subsection (e)(4)B. of this section does not limit or preclude a court, in its determination of whether the arrest of a person was supported by probable cause or its determination of any other matter in a criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding of a type described in that subsection, from considering evidence or testimony that is not otherwise disallowed by subsection (e)(4)B. of this section.

The laboratory report shall contain all of the following:

<P> (3) A report of the type described in subsection (f)(1) of this section shall not be prima-facie evidence of the contents, identity, or amount of any substance if, within seven days after the defendant to whom the report pertains or the defendant’s attorney receives a copy of the report, the defendant or the defendant’s attorney demands the testimony of the person who signed the report. The judge in the case may extend the seven-day time limit in the interest of justice.
