  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>The continual compliance with the terms, contents and conditions of any site plan approved by the Planning Commission is a requirement for issuance of a zoning certificate, and a violation of any of those terms, contents and conditions is grounds for revoking such certificate at any time. All subsequent owners of the land and/or use covered by such site plan shall maintain compliance with the approved site plan. Failure to maintain compliance may result in termination of the use by revocation of the zoning certificate.
