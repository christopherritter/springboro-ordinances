	<B>EDITOR'S NOTE</B>


  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>  The arrangement and numbering of the Codified Ordinances into component codes, titles, chapters and sections are based on an adaptation of the decimal numbering system which is similar to that used in the Ohio Revised Code, and in accord with the best accepted practice in instituting a codification. Each section is self-identifying as to code, chapter and section number. For example, 238.02 indicates that the code number is 2, the chapter number is 238 (or the 38th chapter within code 2), and the section number is .02. The code and chapter numbers appear left of the decimal, with the code number preceding the first two digits left of the decimal, and the chapter number being all digits left of the decimal. The section number appears right of the decimal. As another example, 408.01 indicates the code number is 4, the chapter number is 408 (or the 8th chapter within code 4), and the section number is .01.

  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>  This numbering system has the advantage of inherent flexibility in allowing for an almost endless amount of expansion. Codes, titles and chapters initially are odd-numbered, thus reserving the use of even numbers for future legislation. Sections within chapters are consecutively numbered, except that penalty provisions are usually assigned the number .99 as used in the Revised Code. Newly created sections subsequent to the original codification may be indicated by three digits right of the decimal in the event the law properly belongs between two consecutively numbered sections. For example, newly created 660.061, 660.062 and 660.063 follow 660.06 and precede 660.07 to be placed in their logical position.

  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>  Section histories enable a user to trace the origin of the law contained in the section. The history indicates the derivation by reference to either its passage date and the ordinance number originally assigned to it at that time, or to its inclusion in any prior code. Sections without histories indicate that the section contains new matter which was ordained by the Adopting Ordinance which enacts the Codified Ordinances.

  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>  The Comparative Section Table is included to show the disposition of every ordinance included in the Codified Ordinances. It indicates whether a given ordinance was consolidated with another into one section or split into two or more sections. Cross references direct the user to subject matter reasonably related to material contained within a given chapter.
