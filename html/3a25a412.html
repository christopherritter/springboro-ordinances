  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY> It is the intent of this chapter to establish reasonable regulations which preserve the health, safety and general welfare of the public, while protecting each person's constitutional right to freedom of speech, as indicated by the following objectives:

  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY> (a)  To prohibit signs which pose an unreasonable risk to the public safety.

  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY> (b)  To limit the visual dominance of signs without unconstitutionally restricting the information conveyed.

  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY> (c)  To permit signs appropriate to the land use and location of the property.

  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY> (d)  To maintain an aesthetically pleasing urban environment free of excessive visual clutter.

  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY> (e)  To create a system of variances and appeals to allow exceptions where justified by a hardship.

  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY> (f)  To facilitate rigorous enforcement of this chapter, while preserving each individual's right to due process.
