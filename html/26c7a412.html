<H1>452.04  MANNER OF PARALLEL AND ANGLE PARKING; HANDICAPPED PERSONS.</H1>

  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY> (a) Every vehicle stopped or parked upon a roadway where there is an adjacent curb shall be stopped or parked with the curb side wheels of the vehicle parallel with and not more than twelve inches from the curb, unless it is impossible to approach so close to the curb; in such case the stop shall be as close to the curb as possible and only for the time necessary to discharge and receive passengers or to load or unload merchandise.

  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY> (b) (1) This subsection does not apply to streets or parts thereof where angle parking is lawfully permitted. However, no angle parking shall be permitted on a state route unless an unoccupied roadway width of not less than twenty-five feet is available for free-moving traffic.

  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>  (2) A. No angled parking space that is located on a state route within a municipal corporation is subject to elimination, irrespective of whether there is or is not at least twenty-five feet of unoccupied roadway width available for free-moving traffic at the location of that angled parking space, unless the municipal corporation approves of the elimination of the angled parking space.

  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>   B. Replacement, repainting or any other repair performed by or on behalf of the municipal corporation of the lines that indicate the angled parking space does not constitute an intent by the municipal corporation to eliminate the angled parking space.

  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY> (c) (1) Except as provided in subsection (c)(2) hereof, no vehicle shall be stopped or parked on a road or highway with the vehicle facing in a direction other than the direction of travel on that side of the road or highway.

  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>  (2) The operator of a motorcycle may back the motorcycle into an angled parking space so that when the motorcycle is parked it is facing in a direction other than the direction of travel on the side of the road or highway.

  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY> (d) Notwithstanding any provision of this Code or any rule, air compressors, tractors, trucks and other equipment, while being used in the construction, reconstruction, installation, repair or removal of facilities near, on, over or under a street, may stop, stand or park where necessary in order to perform such work, provided a flagperson is on duty, or warning signs or lights are displayed as may be prescribed by the Ohio Director of Transportation.

  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY> (e) Special parking locations and privileges for persons with disabilities that limit or impair the ability to walk, also known as handicapped parking spaces or disability parking spaces shall be provided and designated by the Municipality and all agencies and instrumentalities thereof at all offices and facilities, where parking is provided, whether owned, rented or leased, and at all publicly owned parking garages. The locations shall be designated through the posting of an elevated sign, whether permanently affixed or movable, imprinted with the international symbol of access and shall be reasonably close to exits, entrances, elevators and ramps. All elevated signs posted in accordance with this subsection and Ohio R.C. 3781.111 (C) shall be mounted on a fixed or movable post, and the distance from the ground to the bottom edge of the sign shall measure not less than five feet. If a new sign or a replacement sign designating a special parking location is posted on or after October 14, 1999, there also shall be affixed upon the surface of that sign or affixed next to the designating sign a notice that states the fine applicable for the offense of parking a motor vehicle in the special designated parking location if the motor vehicle is not legally entitled to be parked in that location.

  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY> (f) (1) No person shall stop, stand or park any motor vehicle at special parking locations provided under subsection (e) hereof, or at special clearly marked parking locations provided in or on privately owned parking lots, parking garages, or other parking areas and designated in accordance with subsection (e) hereof, unless one of the following applies:

  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>   A. The motor vehicle is being operated by or for the transport of a person with a disability that limits or impairs the ability to walk and is displaying a valid removable windshield placard or special license plates;

  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>   B. The motor vehicle is being operated by or for the transport of a handicapped person and is displaying a parking card or special handicapped license plates.

  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>  (2) Any motor vehicle that is parked in a special marked parking location in violation of subsection (f)(1) of this section may be towed or otherwise removed from the parking location by the Police Department. A motor vehicle that is so towed or removed shall not be released to its owner until the owner presents proof of ownership of the motor vehicle and pays all towing and storage fees normally imposed by the Municipality for towing and storing motor vehicles. If the motor vehicle is a leased vehicle, it shall not be released to the lessee until the lessee presents proof that that person is the lessee of the motor vehicle and pays all towing and storage fees normally imposed by the Municipality for towing and storing motor vehicles.

  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>  (3) If a person is charged with a violation of subsection (f)(1) of this section, it is an affirmative defense to the charge that the person suffered an injury not more than seventy-two hours prior to the time the person was issued the ticket or citation and that, because of the injury, the person meets at least one of the criteria contained in Ohio R.C. 4503.44(A)(1).

  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY> (g) When a motor vehicle is being operated by or for the transport of a person with a disability that limits or impairs the ability to walk and is displaying a removable windshield placard or a temporary removable windshield placard or special license plates, or when a motor vehicle is being operated by or for the transport of a handicapped person and is displaying a parking card or special handicapped license plates, the motor vehicle is permitted to park for a period of two hours in excess of the legal parking period permitted by local authorities, except where local ordinances or police rules provide otherwise or where the vehicle is parked in such a manner as to be clearly a traffic hazard.

  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY> (h) As used in this section:

  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>  (1) &quot;Handicapped person&quot; means any person who has lost the use of one or both legs, or one or both arms, who is blind, deaf or so severely handicapped as to be unable to move without the aid of crutches or a wheelchair, or whose mobility is restricted by a permanent cardiovascular, pulmonary or other handicapping condition. 

  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>  (2) &quot;Person with a disability that limits or impairs the ability to walk&quot; has the same meaning as in Ohio R.C. 4503.44.

  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>  (3) &quot;Special license plates&quot; and &quot;removable windshield placard&quot; mean any license plates or removable windshield placard or temporary removable windshield placard issued under Ohio R.C. 4503.41 or 4503.44, and also mean any substantially similar license plates or removable windshield placard or temporary removable windshield placard issued by a state, district, country or sovereignty.

  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY> (i) (1) Whoever violates subsection (a) or (c) of this section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor.

  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>  (2) A. Whoever violates subsection (f)(1)A. or B. of this section is guilty of a misdemeanor and shall be punished as provided in subsection (i)(2)A. and B. of this section. Except as otherwise provided in subsection (i)(2)A. of this section, an offender who violates subsection (f)(1)A. or B. of this section shall be fined not less than two hundred fifty dollars ($250.00) nor more than five hundred dollars ($500.00). An offender who violates subsection (f)(1)A. or B. of this section shall be fined not more than one hundred dollars ($100.00) if the offender, prior to sentencing, proves either of the following to the satisfaction of the court:

  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>    1. At the time of the violation of subsection (f)(1)A. of this section, the offender or the person for whose transport the motor vehicle was being operated had been issued a removable windshield placard that then was valid or special license plates that then were valid but the offender or the person neglected to display the placard or license plates as described in subsection (f)(1)A. of this section.

  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>    2. At the time of the violation of subsection (f)(1)B. of this section, the offender or the person for whose transport the motor vehicle was being operated had been issued a parking card that then was valid or special handicapped license plates that then were valid but the offender or the person neglected to display the card or license plates as described in subsection (f)(1)B. of this section.

  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>   B. In no case shall an offender who violates subsection (f)(1)A. or B. of this section be sentenced to any term of imprisonment.

  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>  An arrest or conviction for a violation of subsection (f)(1)A. or B. of this section does not constitute a criminal record and need not be reported by the person so arrested or convicted in response to any inquiries contained in any application for employment, license, or other right or privilege, or made in connection with the person’s appearance as a witness.
