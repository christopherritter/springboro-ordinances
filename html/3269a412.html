<P>(c) In addition to the penalties described in subsection (b) of this section, if the offender committed the violation by causing a motor vehicle to leave the premises of an establishment at which gasoline is offered for retail sale without the offender making full payment for gasoline that was dispensed into the fuel tank of the motor vehicle or into another container, the court may do one of the following:

<P> (1) Unless subsection (c)(2) of this section applies, suspend for not more than six months the offender’s driver’s license, probationary driver’s license, commercial driver’s license, temporary instruction permit, or nonresident operating privilege;

<P> (2) If the offender’s driver’s license, probationary driver’s license, commercial driver’s license, temporary instruction permit, or nonresident operating privilege has previously been suspended pursuant to subsection (c)(1) of this section, impose a class seven suspension of the offender’s license, permit, or privilege from the range specified in Ohio R.C. 4510.02(A)(7), provided that the suspension shall be for at least six months.

<P> (3) The court, in lieu of suspending the offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license, probationary driver’s license, temporary instruction permit, or nonresident operating privilege pursuant to subsections (c)(1) or (2) of this section, instead may require the offender to perform community service for a number of hours determined by the court.

<P>(e) The sentencing court that suspends an offender’s license, permit, or nonresident operating privilege under subsection (c) of this section may grant the offender limited driving privileges during the period of the suspension in accordance with Ohio R.C. Chapter 4510.
