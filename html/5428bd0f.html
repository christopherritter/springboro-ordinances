<H1>1272.21 FINAL DEVELOPMENT PLAN APPROVAL.</H1>

<P>The Planning Commission shall approve, modify and approve, or deny an application for approval of a final development plan within a reasonable time after the date of such application. Upon approval of the final development plan by the Commission, the Commission shall: 

<P>(a)  Furnish the developer with written notice of approval; 

<P>(b)  Authorize the issuance of a zoning certificate for each structure indicated in the approved final development plan; and

<P>(c) See to it that the final development plan is recorded. Record the final development plan with specific reference to the approved general plan. Approval of a final development plan does not obligate the City Council to approve the record plan. Planning Commission approval of a final development plan is a necessary precondition to consideration and approval of a record plan.

<P> (Ord. 02-4. Passed 1-17-02.)
