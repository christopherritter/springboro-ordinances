<P>(a) No person shall stop or operate a vehicle at such an unreasonably slow speed as to impede or block the normal and reasonable movement of traffic, except when stopping or reduced speed is necessary for safe operation or to comply with law.

<P>(b) Whenever, in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4511.22(B), the minimum speed limit of a controlled-access highway, expressway or freeway has been declared and the appropriate signs giving notice have been erected as required, operators of motor vehicles shall be governed by the speed limitations set forth on such signs. No person shall operate a motor vehicle below the speed limits posted upon such signs except when necessary for safe operation or in compliance with law.

<P>(c) In a case involving a violation of this section, the trier of fact, in determining whether the vehicle was being operated at an unreasonably slow speed, shall consider the capabilities of the vehicle and its operator.

<P>(d) Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, whoever violates this section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor.
