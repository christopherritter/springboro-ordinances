<H1>1619.02 PUBLIC EXHIBITION PERMIT REQUIRED; FEE; BOND; RECORDS.</H1>

<P>(a) A licensed exhibitor of fireworks who wishes to conduct a public fireworks exhibition within the Municipality shall apply for approval to conduct the exhibition to the Fire Chief and from the Police Chief or other similar chief law enforcement officer, or the designee of the Police Chief or similar chief law enforcement officer.

<P>The required approval shall be evidenced by the Fire Chief or Fire Prevention Officer and by the Police Chief or other similar chief law enforcement officer, or the designee of the Police Chief or similar chief law enforcement officer, signing a permit for the exhibition, the form for which shall be prescribed by the State Fire Marshal. Any exhibitor of fireworks who wishes to conduct a public fireworks exhibition may obtain a copy of the form from the Fire Marshal or, if it is available, from the Fire Chief, Fire Prevention Officer, Police Chief or other similar chief law enforcement officer, or the designee of the Police Chief or similar chief law enforcement officer.

<P>(b) Before a permit is signed and issued to a licensed exhibitor of fireworks, the Fire Chief or Fire Prevention Officer in consultation with the Police Chief or other similar chief law enforcement officer, or a designee of such Police Chief or similar chief law enforcement officer, shall inspect the premises on which the exhibition will take place and shall determine that, in fact, the applicant for the permit is a licensed exhibitor of fireworks. Each applicant shall show the applicant’s license as an exhibitor of fireworks to the Fire Chief or Fire Prevention Officer.

<P>The Fire Chief or Fire Prevention Officer and the Police Chief or other similar chief law enforcement officer, or a designee of such Police Chief or similar chief law enforcement officer, shall give approval to conduct a public fireworks exhibition only if satisfied, based on the inspection, that the premises on which the exhibition will be conducted allow the exhibitor to comply with the rules adopted by the Fire Marshal pursuant to Ohio R.C. 3743.53(B) and (E) and that the applicant is, in fact, a licensed exhibitor of fireworks. The Fire Chief or Fire Prevention Officer in consultation with the Police Chief or other similar chief law enforcement officer, or a designee of such Police Chief or similar chief law enforcement officer, may inspect the premises immediately prior to the exhibition to determine if the exhibitor has complied with the rules, and may revoke the permit for noncompliance with the rules.

<P>(c) The Fire Chief or Fire Prevention Officer and the Police Chief or other similar chief law enforcement officer, or a designee of such Police Chief or similar chief law enforcement officer, shall not issue a permit until the applicant pays a permit fee as set forth in Appendix A of Chapter 1464 of the Codified Ordinances plus any necessary costs of investigation of the applicant and of inspecting the premises on which the exhibition will be conducted.

<P>Each exhibitor shall provide an indemnity bond in the amount of at least one million dollars ($1,000,000), with surety satisfactory to the Fire Chief or Fire Prevention Officer and to Police Chief or other similar chief law enforcement officer, or a designee of such Police Chief or similar chief law enforcement officer, conditioned for the payment of all final judgments that may be rendered against the exhibitor on account of injury, death or loss to persons or property emanating from the fireworks exhibition, or proof of insurance coverage of at least one million dollars ($1,000,000) for liability arising from injury, death or loss to persons or property emanating from the fireworks exhibition. The Legislative Authority may require the exhibitor to provide an indemnity bond or proof of insurance coverage in amounts greater than those required by this subsection. The Fire Chief or Fire Prevention Officer and Police Chief or other similar chief law enforcement officer, or a designee of such Police Chief or similar chief law enforcement officer, shall not issue a permit until the exhibitor provides the bond or proof of the insurance coverage required by this subsection.

<P>(d) (1) Each permit for a fireworks exhibition issued by the Fire Chief or Fire Prevention Officer and by the Police Chief or other similar chief law enforcement officer, or a designee of such Police Chief or similar chief law enforcement officer, shall contain a distinct number, designate the Municipality, and identify the certified Fire Safety Inspector, Fire Chief or Fire Prevention Officer who will be present before, during, and after the exhibition, where appropriate. A copy of each permit issued shall be forwarded by the Fire Chief or Fire Prevention Officer and by the Police Chief or other similar chief law enforcement officer, or a designee of such Police Chief or similar chief law enforcement officer, issuing it to the Fire Marshal, who shall keep a record of the permits received. A permit is not transferable or assignable.

<P> (2) The Fire Chief, Fire Prevention Officer and Police Chief or other similar chief law enforcement officer, or a designee of such Police Chief or similar chief law enforcement officer, shall keep a record of issued permits for fireworks exhibitions. In this list, the Fire Chief, Fire Prevention Officer, Police Chief or other similar chief law enforcement officer, or a designee of such Police Chief or similar chief law enforcement officer, shall list the name of the exhibitor, the exhibitor’s license number, the premises on which the exhibition will be conducted, the date and time of the exhibition and the number of the permit issued to the exhibitor for the exhibition.

<P>(e) The governing authority having jurisdiction in the location where an exhibition is to take place shall require that a certified Fire Safety Inspector, Fire Chief, or Fire Prevention Officer be present before, during, and after the exhibition, and shall require the certified Fire Safety Inspector, Fire Chief, or Fire Prevention Officer to inspect the premises where the exhibition is to take place and determine whether the exhibition is in compliance with this chapter and Ohio R.C. Chapter 3743. (ORC 3743.54; Ord. 03-42. Passed 8-21-03.)
