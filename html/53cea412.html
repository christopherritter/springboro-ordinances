<H1>1272.16 PUD APPLICATION STEP 1: AMENDMENT OF OFFICIAL ZONING MAP AND GENERAL PLAN APPROVAL.</H1>

  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY> (a)  Application for PUD zoning shall be made by the property owner or his authorized agent in the same manner as a petition for any other zoning district designation. The rezoning petition shall indicate the category of PUD (PUD-B, PUD-R, etc.) requested. PUD zoning cannot be initiated by the City without the written permission of the property owner. 

  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY> (b)  The general plan (which shall be set forth in one or more maps or instruments) shall be signed by all owners of property within the project, shall be drawn to scale and shall be signed by an architect, landscape architect, civil engineer, or planner-in-charge authorized to practice in the State. Approval of a general plan is a necessary precondition to consideration and approval of the final development plan. 

  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY> 

  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY> (c)  All general plans shall be presented to the Planning Commission by means of an application in the form prescribed by the Planning Commission or its designated officer. The City shall charge for processing of the application based on its actual costs incurred, including in-house processing and review and/or processing and review by public and private consultants. All such costs incurred until and including filing of the Record Plan shall be invoiced. An initial fee as set forth in Appendix A of Chapter <A HREF='58d37b9c.html?f=FifLink&amp;t=document-frame.htm&amp;l=jump&amp;iid=2708dbda.33f0517e.0.0&amp;nid=83#JD_Ch1464'>1464</A> of the Building and Housing Code of the Codified Ordinances shall be payable upon application and shall be credited toward the actual costs of processing. All work done prior to formal application shall be charged to the project upon submission of the application. The developer will be billed monthly, or less frequently if deemed appropriate by the City. Failure to pay such bills within thirty days shall be deemed just cause for delaying further approvals relative to the PUD application and/or construction.
