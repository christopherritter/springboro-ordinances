<H1>Section 5.03 Passage of Ordinances.</H1>

<P>Ordinances and resolutions must be introduced in written or printed form capable of being read if they are of general or permanent nature, grant a franchise, create a right, involve the expenditure of money or levy of a tax, provide for the purchase, lease, sale, or transfer of property.

<P>Ordinances or resolutions of a general or permanent nature or for the purposes set forth above are required to be read by title only, on three different days, unless such readings are dispensed with by a vote of five (5) members elected to the Council. When the requirement of reading on three (3) different days is dispensed with by the required vote, only one (1) reading is required and the ordinance or resolution may be passed forthwith or at a subsequent meeting by the majority vote of Council. (Amended 11-7-00.)
