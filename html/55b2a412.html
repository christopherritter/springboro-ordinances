<H1>1280.14 MODIFICATION OF APPROVED SITE PLAN.</H1>

  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>Minor changes to an approved site plan may be approved by a writing endorsed by the City Engineer if such changes are clearly consistent with the purposes and character of the approved site plan and are in conformance with this chapter and with all other Municipal ordinances and laws. Major changes and changes where consistency with the approved plan is not clear to the City Engineer are subject to the procedural requirements of this chapter in the same manner as an entirely new plan. All applications for modifications to an approved site plan shall be filed with the City Engineer in the same format as an original site plan filing, to the extent applicable.

  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>(Ord. 00-16. Passed 2-17-00.)
