<H1>1262.03 PERMIT APPLICATIONS. </H1>

<P>All applications for building permits shall be accompanied by plans, in triplicate, drawn to scale, showing the actual dimensions and shape of the lot to be built upon; the exact sizes and locations on the lot of buildings already existing, if any; and the locations and dimensions of the proposed building or alteration. The application shall include such other information as lawfully may be required by the Building and Zoning Inspector, including existing or proposed building or alteration; existing or proposed uses of the building and land; the number of families, housekeeping units or conditions existing on the lot; and such other matters as may be necessary to determine conformity with, and provide for the enforcement of, this Zoning Code. One copy of the plans shall be returned to the applicant by the Inspector, after he or she has marked such copy either as approved or disapproved and attested to the same by his or her signature on such copy. The original and one copy of the plans, similarly marked, shall be retained by the Inspector. 

<P>(Ord. 546B. Passed 2-25-76.)
