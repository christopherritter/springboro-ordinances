<H1>202.04  REVIVOR; EFFECT OF AMENDMENT OR REPEAL.</H1>

<P>(a) The repeal of a repealing ordinance does not revive the ordinance originally repealed nor impair the effect of any saving clause therein.

<P>(ORC 1.57)

<P>(b) An ordinance which is re-enacted or amended is intended to be a continuation of the prior ordinance and not a new enactment, so far as it is the same as the prior ordinance.

<P>(ORC 1.54)

<P>(c) The re-enactment, amendment or repeal of an ordinance does not, except as provided in subsection (d) hereof:

<P> (1) Affect the prior operation of the ordinance or any prior action taken thereunder;

<P> (2) Affect any validation, cure, right, privilege, obligation or liability previously acquired, accrued, accorded or incurred thereunder;

<P> (3) Affect any violation thereof or penalty, forfeiture or punishment incurred in respect thereto, prior to the amendment or repeal;

<P> (4) Affect any investigation, proceeding or remedy in respect of any such privilege, obligation, liability, penalty, forfeiture or punishment; and the investigation, proceeding or remedy may be instituted, continued or enforced, and the penalty, forfeiture or punishment imposed, as if the ordinance had not been repealed or amended.

<P>(d) If the penalty, forfeiture or punishment for any offense is reduced by a re-enactment or amendment of an ordinance, the penalty, forfeiture, or punishment, if not already imposed, shall be imposed according to the ordinance as amended.

<P>(ORC 1.58)
