<H1>1278.03 BUILDINGS UNDER CONSTRUCTION.</H1>

<P>To avoid undue hardship, nothing in this Zoning Code shall be deemed to require a change in the plans, construction or designated use of any building on which actual construction was lawfully begun prior to the effective date of adoption (Ord. 546B, passed February 25, 1976) or amendment of this Zoning Code which would prohibit or limit such construction, and upon which actual building construction has been carried on diligently. As used in this section, “actual building construction” means and includes the placing of construction materials in a permanent position, fastened in a permanent manner. In the case of excavation or demolition or removal of an existing building, such excavation, demolition or removal shall be deemed to be actual construction if the work is carried on diligently.

<P>(Ord. 99-20. Passed 5-6-99.)
