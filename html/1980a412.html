<H1>280.041 STREET TREES AND PLANTING ZONES.</H1>

  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY> (a) <U>Street Tree Planting Zones. </U>

  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>(1) There are four designate zones for planting street trees within the right-of- way:

  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>A. Curbside. Located between a detached sidewalk and the curb; commonly known as the tree lawn. At least six feet are needed if trees are to be planted; wider spaces are preferred. Trees should be centered in the Tree Lawn. 

  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>B.  Boundary. Located behind a sidewalk between the right-of-way line and the sidewalk. Street trees must be planted at least three feet from the sidewalk.

  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>C. Sidewalk. The open section of a sidewalk where the walk extends from the curb to the building. The walk must be wide enough to allow the tree to be set back at least three feet from the face of the curb and five feet from the building.

  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>D. Undefined. Located in areas that do not have a sidewalk. The location of trees should anticipate the future installation of a sidewalk. Street trees planted in undefined areas should be centered between the back of the curb and an imaginary line parallel to the right-of-way line and three feet within the right-of-way.

  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>(2) Help organize architectural space.

  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>(3) Reinforce the lineal form of streets.

  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>(4) Enhance urban elements, not hide them.

  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>(5) Have trunks rising from an uncluttered ground form.

  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>(6) Provide symbolic significance, where possible.

  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>(7) Reinforce good architecture.

  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>(8) Improve connections between indoor and outdoor space.
