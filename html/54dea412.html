<H1>1278.09 REPAIRS AND MAINTENANCE.</H1>

  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>On any nonconforming structure or portion of a structure containing a nonconforming use, work may be done in any period of twelve consecutive months on ordinary repairs, or on the repair or replacement of nonbearing walls, fixtures, wiring or plumbing, to an extent not exceeding ten percent of the current replacement cost of the nonconforming structure or nonconforming portion of the structure, as the case may be, provided that the cubic content existing when it becomes nonconforming shall not be increased. If a nonconforming structure or portion of a structure containing a nonconforming use becomes physically unsafe or unlawful due to lack of repairs and maintenance, and it is declared by a duly authorized official to be unsafe or unlawful by reason of physical condition, it shall not thereafter be restored, repaired or rebuilt except in conformity with the regulations of the district in which it is located. Nothing in this Zoning Code shall be deemed to prevent the strengthening or restoring to a safe condition of any building or part thereof declared to be unsafe by any official charged with protecting the public safety, upon order of such official.

  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>(Ord. 546B. Passed 2-25-76.)
