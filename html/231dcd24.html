<P>(b) Upon the request or motion of the prosecuting authority, a noncertified copy of the law enforcement automated data system report or a noncertified copy of a record of the Registrar of Motor Vehicles that shows the name, date of birth, and social security number of a person charged with a violation of subsection (a) of this section may be admitted into evidence as prima- facie evidence that the license of the person was under suspension at the time of the alleged violation of subsection (a) of this section.  The person charged with a violation of subsection (a) of this section may offer evidence to rebut this prima-facie evidence.

<P>(c) Whoever violates subsection (a) of this section is guilty of driving under suspension and shall be punished as provided in subsection (c) of this section.
