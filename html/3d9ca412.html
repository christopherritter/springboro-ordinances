  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY> (a) The United States Supreme Court decision in Barnes v. Glen Theatre, Inc., 501 U.S. 560 (1991), which upheld the rights of cities to prohibit live public exposure of a person's private parts, specifically applies to sexually oriented businesses (regardless of whether or not a permit has been issued to said businesses under this chapter), including said businesses where no alcoholic beverages are sold, served, or consumed at the premises.
