<H1>1262.16 STAY OF PROCEEDINGS. </H1>

<P>An appeal stays all proceedings in furtherance of the action appealed from, unless the deputy building and zoning inspector, from whom the appeal is taken, certifies to the Board of Zoning Appeals, after the notice of appeal is filed with him or her, that by reason of facts stated in the certificate, a stay would, in his or her opinion, cause imminent peril to life and property. In such case, proceedings shall not be stayed other than by a restraining order which may be granted by the Board or by a court of record on application, on notice to the inspector from whom the appeal is taken and on due cause shown. 

<P>(Ord. 546B. Passed 2-25-76.)
