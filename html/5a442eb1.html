<H1>1610.04  ENFORCEMENT; RESPONSIBILITIES OF MUNICIPAL FIRE SAFETY INSPECTOR. </H1>

<P>(a)  No person shall serve as Municipal Fire Safety Inspector unless he has received a certificate issued by the State Board of Emergency Medical Services under former Ohio R.C. 3303.07 or 4765.55 evidencing his satisfactory completion of a fire safety inspection training program.

<P>(ORC 3737.34)

<P>(b)  The Municipal Fire Safety Inspector, upon examination or inspection, shall issue citations when he finds conditions as specified in Ohio R.C. 3737.41 which are especially dangerous to the safety of persons, buildings, premises or property, and shall make any necessary remedial orders in connection therewith. Citation enforcement may be by use of the procedures established by Ohio R.C. 3737.42 for hearing on the citation or Ohio R.C. 3737.44 for injunctive relief or a temporary restraining order and oral order for vacation of the building or premises. 

<P>(c)  The Municipal Fire Safety Inspector, upon reasonable belief and after inspection or investigation, shall, with reasonable promptness, issue a citation to the responsible person for a violation of the Ohio Fire Code or any order issued by the Ohio Fire Marshal or any Municipal Fire Safety Inspector. The citation shall fix a reasonable time for abatement of the violation. Each citation issued under this subsection shall be prominently posted by the responsible person, as prescribed by the Ohio Fire Code, at or near each place a violation referred to in the citation occurs. 

<P>(d)  Upon request of the Municipal Fire Safety Inspector, the Solicitor shall institute and prosecute any necessary action or proceeding to enforce this chapter or Ohio R.C. Chapter 3737.
