<H1>1270.05 STANDARDS APPLICABLE TO ALL CONDITIONALLY PERMITTED USES. </H1>

<P>The location and size of the conditionally permitted use, the nature and intensity of the operations involved, the size of the site in relation to it, and the location of the site with respect to the existing and future streets giving access to it, shall be such that the use will be in harmony with the orderly development of the district in which it is located, and the location, nature and height of buildings, walls and fences will not discourage the appropriate development and use of adjacent land and buildings or impair the value thereof. 

<P>In addition, operations in connection with any such use shall not be more objectionable to nearby properties, by reason of noise, fumes, vibrations or flashing light, than the operation of any permitted use would be. 

<P>(Ord. 546B. Passed 2-25-76.)
