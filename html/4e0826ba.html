<H1>1264.065 RBD RESIDENTIAL BUSINESS DISTRICT. </H1>

  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY> (a)  <U>Purposes.</U> The purpose of the RBD District is to allow certain retail and office functions to be performed in an area originally built primarily for residential uses but which is now in transition to mixed use. Further, the purpose is to allow for a transition to mixed use while retaining the essentially residential nature and appearance of the general area, to encourage the continued use of the area as a residential area as well as a commercial district and to maximize the compatibility of this mixed use development with immediately adjacent residential properties.

  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY> In order to achieve the purposes of the District, not all uses that are customarily associated with residential-limited retail office districts are included as permitted uses or conditional uses. 

  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY> (b)  <U>Permitted Uses</U>. Permitted uses are as follows: 

  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>  (1)  Single-family dwellings; 

  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>  (2)  Multifamily dwellings; 

  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>  (3)  Mixed residential and commercial uses as otherwise permitted by this section; 

  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>  (4)  Offices, such as professional and business, provided that the products sold are either manufactured on site, sold as parts or accessories to products sold or manufactured on site or stored or distributed by the owner or lessee of the office, and further provided that not more than thirty percent of the floor space of the main building may be devoted to retail sales, as permitted in this paragraph, and that service facilities are limited to the repair and/or service of products manufactured, stored or distributed by the owner or lessee of the office; 

  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>  (5)  Personal service agencies, such as real estate agencies, insurance agencies, security services, messenger services, computer services, travel agencies, etc.;

In this district, &quot;home occupations&quot; means that:

  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>   A.  Not more than two persons not residing on the premises shall be engaged in such occupation.

  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>   B.  There shall be no change in the outside appearance of the building or premises, or other visible evidence of the conduct of the home occupation, other than such signs as are otherwise provided for businesses in Chapter <A HREF='54966c10.html?f=FifLink&amp;t=document-frame.htm&amp;l=jump&amp;iid=2708dbda.33f0517e.0.0&amp;nid=c33#JD_Ch1276'>1276</A>.

  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>   C.  Not more than fifty percent of the floor space of the dwelling unit shall be used in the conduct of the home occupation.

In the case of electrical interference, no equipment or process shall be used which creates visible or audible interference in any radio or television receiver off the premises or causes fluctuation in the voltages off the premises.
