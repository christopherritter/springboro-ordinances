That portion of a building or other enclosed structure that is owned by the State, a State agency or a political subdivision and that is used primarily as a food service establishment is not a place of public assembly.

  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>  (3) Each portion of a building or enclosed structure that is not included in subsection (a)(1) or (2) hereof is a place of public assembly if it has a seating capacity of fifty or more persons and is available to the public. Restaurants, food service establishments, dining rooms, cafes, cafeterias or other rooms used primarily for the service of food, as well as bowling alleys and places licensed by the Department of Liquor Control to sell intoxicating beverages for consumption on the premises, are not places of public assembly.

  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY> (b) For the purpose of separating persons who smoke from persons who do not smoke for the comfort and health of persons not smoking, in every place of public assembly there shall be an area where smoking is not permitted, which shall be designated a no smoking area. Provided that, no more than one-half of the rooms in any health care facility in which persons are confined as a matter of health care may be designated as smoking areas in their entirety. The designation shall be made before the place of public assembly is made available to the public. In places included in subsection (a)(1) hereof the local fire authority having jurisdiction shall designate no smoking area. In places included in subsection (a)(2) hereof that are owned by the Municipality, Council shall designate an officer who shall designate the area. In places included in subsection (a)(3) hereof, the person having control of the operations of the place of public assembly shall designate the no smoking area. In places included in subsection (a)(2) hereof which are also included in subsection (a)(1) hereof, the officer who has authority to designate the area in places in subsection (a)(2) hereof shall designate the no smoking area. A no smoking area may include the entire place of public assembly. Designations shall be made by the placement of signs that are clearly visible and that state &quot;NO SMOKING&quot;. No person shall remove signs from areas designated as no smoking areas.

  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY> (c) This section does not affect or modify the prohibition contained in Ohio R.C. 3313.751(B).

  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY> (d) No person shall smoke in any area designated as a no smoking area in accordance with subsection (b) hereof or Ohio R.C. 3791.031.
