<H1>880.05  RETURN AND PAYMENT OF TAX.</H1>

  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY> (a) Each resident, except as herein provided, shall, whether or not a tax is due thereon, make and file a return on or before April 15 for the 2004 taxable year and all taxable years thereafter. When the return is made for a fiscal year or other period different from the calendar year, the return shall be filed on or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month from the end of such fiscal year or period. The Administrator is hereby authorized to provide, by regulation, that the return of an employer or employers, showing the amount of tax deducted by such employer or employers from the salaries, wages, commissions or other compensation of an employee, and paid by him or her or them to the Administrator, shall be accepted, unless otherwise specified, as the return required of any employee whose sole income, subject to tax under this chapter, is such salary, wages, commissions or other compensation. 
(Ord. 05-3. Passed 1-6-05.)

  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY> (b)  The return shall be filed with the Administrator on a form or forms furnished by, or obtainable upon request from, such Administrator setting forth: 

  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>  (1)  The aggregate amounts of salaries, wages, commissions and other compensation earned, including all income derived or received from lotteries, gaming, wagering or other schemes of chance by residents of the Municipality, provided the total income received from such lotteries, gaming, wagering or other schemes of chance is equal to or greater than five thousand dollars ($5,000), any deduction taken for ordinary and necessary expenses of an employee and a copy of Federal Form 2106 and Schedule A of the federal tax return from which such deduction is derived, and gross income from the business, profession or other activity, less the allowable ordinary, reasonable and necessary expenses incurred in the acquisition of such gross income earned during the preceding year and subject to such tax; 

  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>  (2)  The amount of the tax imposed by this chapter on such earnings and profits; and 

  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>  (3)  Such other pertinent statements, information returns or other information as the Administrator may require. 
(Ord. 04-23. Passed 6-17-04.)

  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY> (c)  The Administrator may extend the time for filing the annual return upon receipt of a copy of the Federal Extension request by the due date contained in Section <A HREF='3f8afd77.html?f=FifLink&amp;t=document-frame.htm&amp;l=jump&amp;iid=2708dbda.33f0517e.0.0&amp;nid=553#JD_88005'>880.05</A>(a) for a period not to extend past the last day of the month following the month to which the due date of the federal income tax return has been extended. Payment in full of all income taxes owed, up to and including the tax year for which the extension request is being made, must be paid by the due date contained in Section <A HREF='3f8afd77.html?f=FifLink&amp;t=document-frame.htm&amp;l=jump&amp;iid=2708dbda.33f0517e.0.0&amp;nid=553#JD_88005'>880.05</A>(a), before an extension request will be granted. There will be no extension granted for payment of tax due.

  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY> (d)  (1)  The taxpayer making a return shall, at the time of the filing thereof, pay to the Administrator the amount of taxes shown as due thereon, provided, however, that where any portion of the tax so due has been deducted at the source pursuant to Section <A HREF='3f9c6b60.html?f=FifLink&amp;t=document-frame.htm&amp;l=jump&amp;iid=2708dbda.33f0517e.0.0&amp;nid=53f#JD_88006'>880.06</A>, or where any portion of the tax has been paid by the taxpayer pursuant to Section <A HREF='3fa74488.html?f=FifLink&amp;t=document-frame.htm&amp;l=jump&amp;iid=2708dbda.33f0517e.0.0&amp;nid=545#JD_88007'>880.07</A>, or where an income tax has been paid to another municipality, credit for the amount so paid in accordance with Sections <A HREF='3f9c6b60.html?f=FifLink&amp;t=document-frame.htm&amp;l=jump&amp;iid=2708dbda.33f0517e.0.0&amp;nid=53f#JD_88006'>880.06</A>, <A HREF='3fa74488.html?f=FifLink&amp;t=document-frame.htm&amp;l=jump&amp;iid=2708dbda.33f0517e.0.0&amp;nid=545#JD_88007'>880.07</A> and <A HREF='4002a7d8.html?f=FifLink&amp;t=document-frame.htm&amp;l=jump&amp;iid=2708dbda.33f0517e.0.0&amp;nid=543#JD_88015'>880.15</A> shall be deducted from the amount shown to be due and only the balance, if any, shall be due and payable at the time of filing the return. 

  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>  (2)  A taxpayer who has overpaid the amount of tax to which the Municipality is entitled under this chapter may have such overpayment applied against any subsequent liability under this chapter or, at his or her election indicated on the return, such overpayment (or part thereof) shall be refunded, provided that no additional taxes or refunds of less than ten dollars ($10.00) shall be collected or refunded. 

  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>   (Ord. 05-3. Passed 1-6-05.)

  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY> (e)  (1)  Where necessary, a taxpayer must file an amended return in order to report additional income and pay any additional tax due, or claim a refund of tax overpaid, subject to the requirements and/or limitations contained in Sections <A HREF='3fdcb639.html?f=FifLink&amp;t=document-frame.htm&amp;l=jump&amp;iid=2708dbda.33f0517e.0.0&amp;nid=541#JD_88011'>880.11</A> and <A HREF='4002a7d8.html?f=FifLink&amp;t=document-frame.htm&amp;l=jump&amp;iid=2708dbda.33f0517e.0.0&amp;nid=543#JD_88015'>880.15</A>. Such amended returns shall be on a form obtainable on request from the Administrator. A taxpayer may not change the method of accounting or apportionment of net profits after the due date for filing the original return. 

  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>  (2)  Within three months from the final determination of any Federal tax liability affecting the taxpayer's tax liability to the Municipality, such taxpayer shall make and file an amended return showing income subject to the income tax of the Municipality, based upon such final determination of the Federal tax liability, and pay any additional tax shown due thereon or make a claim for refund of any overpayment.

  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>   (Ord. 731. Passed 6-1-78.)
