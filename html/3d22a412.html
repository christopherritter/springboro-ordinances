<H1>840.13 EXPIRATION OF PERMIT.</H1>

  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY> (a) Each permit shall expire one year from the date of issuance and may be renewed only by making application as provided in Section <A HREF='3cfb9fda.html?f=FifLink&amp;t=document-frame.htm&amp;l=jump&amp;iid=2708dbda.33f0517e.0.0&amp;nid=7f3#JD_84010'>840.10</A> (for renewals, filing of original survey shall be sufficient). Application for renewal shall be made at least thirty days before the expiration date, and when made less than thirty days before the expiration date, the expiration of the permit will not be affected.

  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY> (b) When the Director of Department of Police or his/her designee, denies renewal of the permit, the applicant shall not be issued a permit under this chapter for one year from the date of denial. If, subsequent to denial, the City or its designee, finds that the basis for denial of the renewal of the permit has been corrected, the applicant shall be granted a permit if at least ninety days have elapsed since-the date denial became final.

  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>(Ord. 96-20. Passed 3-7-96.)
