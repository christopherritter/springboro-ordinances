<P>When the notice of vacation follows a notice of abatement, as provided in Section <A HREF="37312874.html">668.03</A>, without a previous notice of abatement, such notice of vacation shall not be enforced as provided in this chapter unless it specifies a time, not less than five days after the service thereof, when the person so notified may appear before the Board issuing the same to show cause why such notice should not be enforced, and unless the Board, or a majority thereof, is present at its office at the time so specified, provided that when, in the opinion of at least four-fifths of the members of the Board, an emergency exists which requires, for the protection of the health of occupants, the vacation of the building or portion thereof without a delay of five days, then no such fixing of a time for hearing shall be required.
