  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>  (2) <U>Design factors</U><I>.</I> Sanitary sewer systems should be designed for the ultimate tributary population. The Director of Planning and the City Engineer should provide the Planning Commission with a report with their best judgement on the anticipated population to be served by the sewer based upon available zoning regulations, planning and zoning reports, census data, and anticipated increase in demand caused by the installation of the proposed addition to the sanitary sewer system.

  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>  (6) <U>Manholes.</U> The difference in elevation between any incoming sewer and the manhole invert shall not exceed twelve inches (12”) except where required to match crowns. The use of drop manholes will require approval by the City Engineer. The minimum inside diameter of the manholes shall conform to those specified by the City Engineer. Inside drop manholes are not permitted. When a smaller sewer joins a larger one, the crown of the smaller sewer shall not be lower than that of the larger one. 

  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>  (7) <U>Sanitary sewer locations</U><I>.</I> Sanitary sewers shall be located within street or alley rights-of-way unless specifically approved by the City Engineer. When located in easements on private property, access shall be provided to all manholes. Not less than four feet (4’) of cover shall be provided over the top of pipe.

  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>  (8) <U>Cleanouts and lampholes</U><I>.</I> Cleanouts and lampholes shall not be permitted. Cleanouts shall be permitted on sewer laterals at one hundred foot (100’) intervals.

  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>  (9) <U>Water supply interconnections</U><I>.</I> Interconnections between the water and sewer lines shall not be permitted as per Ohio Department of Environmental Protection (EPA) standards.
