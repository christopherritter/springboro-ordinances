<H1>642.25  DETERMINING PROPERTY VALUE IN ARSON.</H1>

  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY> (a) The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of property or amount of physical harm involved in a violation of Section <A HREF='32c4815f.html?f=FifLink&amp;t=document-frame.htm&amp;l=jump&amp;iid=2708dbda.33f0517e.0.0&amp;nid=11d#JD_64209'>642.09:</A>

  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>  (1) If the property is an heirloom, memento, collector’s item, antique, museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing which is either irreplaceable or is replaceable only on the expenditure of substantial time, effort or money, the value of property or the amount of physical harm involved is the amount which would compensate the owner for its loss.

  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>  (2) If the property is not covered under paragraph (a)(1) hereof, and the physical harm is such that the property can be restored substantially to its former condition, the amount of physical harm involved is the reasonable cost of restoring the property.

  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>  (3) If the property is not covered under paragraph (a)(1) hereof, and the physical harm is such that the property cannot be restored substantially to its former condition, the value of the property, in the case of personal property, is the cost of replacing the property with new property of like kind and quality, and in the case of real property or real property fixtures, is the difference in the fair market value of the property immediately before and immediately after the offense.

  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY> (b) As used in this section, “fair market value” has the same meaning as defined in Section <A HREF='33691138.html?f=FifLink&amp;t=document-frame.htm&amp;l=jump&amp;iid=2708dbda.33f0517e.0.0&amp;nid=b57#JD_64224'>642.24</A>(c)(3).

  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY> (c) Prima-facie evidence of the value of property, as provided in Section <A HREF='33691138.html?f=FifLink&amp;t=document-frame.htm&amp;l=jump&amp;iid=2708dbda.33f0517e.0.0&amp;nid=b57#JD_64224'>642.24</A>(d), may be used to establish the value of property pursuant to this section.
