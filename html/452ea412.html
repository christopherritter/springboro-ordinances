<H1>1044.15 DELINQUENCIES; COLLECTION; TERMINATION OF SERVICE. </H1>

<P>If charges for service are not paid within thirty days after the bill is rendered then such service charges shall be deemed and are hereby declared to be delinquent. Thereafter, such delinquent charges shall constitute a lien upon the real estate for which such sewer services were supplied and shall be certified to the County Auditor for collection. If charges are not paid within forty-five days, the Municipality may discontinue service after ten days notice. Charges accruing under the provisions of Sections <A HREF="44cbbcd4.html">1044.14</A> are collectible by the City or its authorized agent along with reasonable administrative costs thereon by other means. Reasonable administrative costs associated with the collection of delinquent utility bills include but are not limited to, fees in an amount up to an additional fifty percent (50%) of the total delinquent amount, including the tax amount, interest and penalties of any post judgment account assigned to a collection agency. (Ord. 10-27. Passed 6-17-10.)
