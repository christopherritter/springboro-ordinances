<H1>880.08 POWERS AND DUTIES OF THE ADMINISTRATOR; ENFORCEMENT. </H1>

<P>(a)  The Administrator shall receive the tax imposed by this chapter in the manner prescribed in this chapter from the taxpayers, shall keep an accurate record thereof and shall report all moneys so received. 

<P>The Administrator shall enforce the payment of all taxes owed to the Municipality, shall keep accurate records for a minimum of five years showing the amount due from each taxpayer required to file a declaration and/or to make any return, including taxes withheld, and shall show the dates and amounts of payments thereof. 

<P>(b)  The Administrator is hereby charged with the enforcement of this chapter and is hereby authorized, subject to the approval of the Board of Review, to adopt and promulgate and to enforce the rules and regulations relating to any matter or thing pertaining to the collection of taxes and the administration and enforcement of this chapter, including provisions for the re-examination and correction of returns. 

<P>The Administrator is authorized to arrange for the payment of unpaid taxes, interest and penalties on a schedule of installment payments, when the taxpayer has proved to the Administrator that due to certain hardship conditions he or she is unable to pay the full amount of the tax due. Such authorization shall not be granted until proper returns are filed by the taxpayer for all amounts owed by him or her under this chapter. 

<P>Failure to make any deferred payment when due shall cause the total unpaid amount, including penalty and interest, to become payable on demand and the provisions of Sections <A HREF="3fdcb639.html">880.99</A> shall apply. 

<P>(c)  In any case where a taxpayer has failed to file a return or has filed a return which does not show the proper amount of tax due, the Administrator may determine the amount of tax appearing to be due to the Municipality from the taxpayer and shall send to such taxpayer a written statement showing the amount of tax so determined, together with interest and penalties thereon, if any. 

<P>(d)  Subject to the consent of the Board of Review or pursuant to regulation approved by the Board, the Administrator shall have the power to compromise any interest or penalty, or both, imposed under Section<A HREF="3fd24c40.html"> 880.10.</A>
