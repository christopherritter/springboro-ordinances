<H1>1246.04 ESCROW DEPOSITS FOR LOT IMPROVEMENTS.</H1>

<P>(a) Whenever, by reason of the season of the year, any lot improvements required by the subdivision regulations cannot be performed, the Building Inspector may issue a certificate of occupancy, provided there is no danger to health, safety, or general welfare upon accepting a cash escrow deposit in an amount to be determined by the Director of Planning for the cost of the lot improvements. The subdivision improvement agreement and security covering the lot improvements shall remain in full force and effect.

<P>(b) All required improvements for which escrow monies have been accepted by the Planning Director at the time of issuance of a certificate of occupancy shall be installed by the subdivider within a period of nine (9) months from the date of deposit and issuance of the certificate of occupancy. If the improvements have not been properly installed at the end of the time period, the Director of Planning shall give two (2) weeks written notice to the developer requiring it to install the improvements, and if they are not then installed properly, the Building and Zoning Inspector may request the City to proceed to contract out the work for the installation of the necessary improvements in a sum not to exceed the amount of the escrow deposit. At the time of the issuance of the certificate of occupancy for which escrow monies are being deposited with the Director of Planning, the developer shall obtain and file with the Building and Zoning Inspector prior to obtaining the certificate of occupancy and a notarized statement from the purchaser or the purchasers of the premises authorizing the Director of Planning to install the improvements at the end of the nine (9) month period if the improvements have not been duly installed by the subdivider.

<P>(Ord. 04-41. Passed 8-19-04.)
