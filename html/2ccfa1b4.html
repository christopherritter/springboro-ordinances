<P>(a)  No person under Section <A HREF="2cbad659.html">618.51</A>, shall allow such animal to remain within the City unless and until he/she has first secured a permit so to do and complies with all terms and conditions of such permit; and, in addition thereto, such animal shall at all times be so confined, controlled and restrained in such manner so the life, limb or property of any person lawfully entering such premises shall not be endangered. 

<P>(b)  Failure to obtain a permit when required by subsection (a) after written notification by the Chief Animal Control Officer or his/her authorized deputy shall be adequate grounds for such officer or deputy to impound such animal until a permit is obtained.
