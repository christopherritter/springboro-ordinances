<H1>1278.07  NONCONFORMING STRUCTURES.</H1>

<P>Where a lawful structure exists on the effective date of adoption or amendment of this Zoning Code (Ordinance 546B, passed February 25, 1976) that cannot be built under the provisions of this Zoning Code by reason of restrictions on area, lot coverage, height, yards, its location on the lot or other requirements concerning the structure, such structure may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following provisions:

<P>(a) No such nonconforming structure shall be enlarged or altered in a way which increases its nonconformity, but any structure or portion thereof may be altered to decrease its nonconformity.

<P>(b) Should such nonconforming structure or a nonconforming portion of such structure be destroyed by any means to an extent of more than fifty percent of its replacement cost at the time of destruction, it shall not be reconstructed except in conformity with this Zoning Code.

<P>(c) Should such structure be moved for any reason for any distance, it shall thereafter conform to the regulations for the district in which it is located after it is moved.

<P> (Ord. 99-20. Passed 5-6-99.)
