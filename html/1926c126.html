<H1>280.01 DEFINITIONS.</H1>

<P>(a) “Clearing” means any intentional or negligent act to cut down, remove all or a substantial part of, or damage a tree or other vegetation that will cause the tree(s) or vegetation to decline or die. Such acts shall also include but are not limited to damage to root systems by the application of toxic substances, by the operation of equipment and vehicles, by storage of materials, by the change in natural grade due to unapproved excavation or filling, or by the unapproved alteration of natural physical conditions.

<P>(b) “Critical root zone” means a circular region measured outward from the tree trunk that represents the essential area of roots that must be maintained for the tree's survival. “Critical root zone” is one foot of radial distance for every inch of tree DBH, with a minimum of eight feet. The formula changes to one and one-half feet for every inch at DBH Monarch trees.

<P>(c) “DBH” or “Diameter at Breast Height” means the tree trunk diameter measured in inches at four and one-half feet above the ground. If a tree splits into multiple trunks below four and one-half feet, the trunk is measured at its most narrow point beneath the split.

<P>(d) “Dripline” means a vertical line extending from the outermost edge of the tree canopy or shrub branch to the ground.

<P>(e) “Monarch Tree” means a tree that has been determined by the Tree Authority and the City Council to be of high value because of its size, age, form, historical significance, or some professional criteria.

<P>(f) “Protected Tree” means any tree with a DBH of five inches or more, unless exempted by the specific language of this chapter.

<P>(g) “Reforestation” means the creation of a biological community dominated by trees and other woody plants containing at least 100 live trees per acre, with at least fifty percent (50%) of those trees having the potential of attaining a two inch or greater DBH within seven years. “Reforestation” includes landscaping of areas under an approved landscaping plan that establishes a forest that is at least thirty-five feet wide and covering 2,500 square feet of area.

<P>(h) “Shrub” means a woody plant that usually remains low and produces shoots or stems from its base, and is not usually tree-like or single-stemmed.

<P>(i) “Tree” means any self-supporting woody plant that usually provides one main trunk, and produces a more or less distinct and elevated head with many branches.

<P>(i)  “Vegetation” means all plant life; however, for purposes of this chapter, it shall be restricted to mean trees, shrubs, and vines.

<P>(k)  “Vine” means a woody plant whose stem climbs by tendrils or twining, or creeps along the ground.
