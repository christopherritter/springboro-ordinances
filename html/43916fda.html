<P>The Division of Water shall have no authority to make reductions or corrections in water bills where leakage has occurred in any water pipe, tank or other apparatus or device. The amount of water registered by the meter serving the property shall be charged and paid for in full, irrespective of whether such water, after having been registered, was lost by leakage, accident or otherwise. No rebate or discount will be allowed because of leaks, open faucets or otherwise. (Ord. 235A. Passed 9-7-61.)
