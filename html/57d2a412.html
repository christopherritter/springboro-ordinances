<P>Any proposed action exempt from filing for a floodplain development permit is also exempt from the standards of these regulations.

<P>(j) <U>Map Maintenance Activities</U>. To meet National Flood Insurance Program minimum requirements to have flood data reviewed and approved by FEMA, and to ensure that City of Springboro flood maps, studies and other data identified in Section <A HREF="576787ff.html">1448.01</A>(f) accurately represent flooding conditions so appropriate floodplain management criteria are based on current data, the following map maintenance activities are identified:

<P> (1) <U>Requirement to Submit New Technical Data</U>.

<P>  A. For all development proposals that impact floodway delineations or base flood elevations, the community shall ensure that technical data reflecting such changes be submitted to FEMA within six months of the date such information becomes available. These development proposals include:

<P>   1. Floodway encroachments that increase or decrease base flood elevations or alter floodway boundaries; 

<P>   2. Fill sites to be used for the placement of proposed structures where the applicant desires to remove the site from the special flood hazard area;

<P>   3. Alteration of watercourses that result in a relocation or elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the placement of culverts; and

<P>   4. Subdivision or large scale development proposals requiring the establishment of base flood elevations in accordance with Section <A HREF="58253716.html">1448.04</A>(c).

<P>  B. It is the responsibility of the applicant to have technical data, required in accordance with Section <A HREF="57d2ab80.html">1448.03</A>(j)(1), prepared in a format required for a Conditional Letter of Map Revision or Letter of Map Revision, and submitted to FEMA. Submittal and processing fees for these map revisions shall be the responsibility of the applicant.

<P>  C. The Floodplain Administrator shall require a Conditional Letter of Map Revision prior to the issuance of a floodplain development permit for:

<P>   1. Proposed floodway encroachments that increase the base flood elevation; and

<P>   2. Proposed development which increases the base flood elevation by more than one foot in areas where FEMA has provided base flood elevations but no floodway.

<P>  D. Floodplain development permits issued by the Floodplain Administrator shall be conditioned upon the applicant obtaining a Letter of Map Revision from FEMA for any development proposal subject to Section <A HREF="57d2ab80.html">1448.03</A>(j)(1)A.

<P> (2) <U>Right to Submit New Technical Data</U>. The Floodplain Administrator may request changes to any of the information shown on an effective map that does not impact floodplain or floodway delineations or base flood elevations, such as labeling or planimetric details. Such a submission shall include appropriate supporting documentation made in writing by the Mayor of City of Springboro, and may be submitted at any time.

<P> (3) <U>Annexation / Detachment</U>. Upon occurrence, the Floodplain Administrator shall notify FEMA in writing whenever the boundaries of the City of Springboro have been modified by annexation or the community has assumed authority over an area, or no longer has authority to adopt and enforce floodplain management regulations for a particular area. In order that the City of Springboro Flood Insurance Rate Map accurately represent the City of Springboro boundaries, include within such notification a copy of a map of the City of Springboro suitable for reproduction, clearly showing the new corporate limits or the new area for which the City of Springboro has assumed or relinquished floodplain management regulatory authority.

<P>(k) <U>Data Use and Flood Map Interpretation</U>. The following guidelines shall apply to the use and interpretation of maps and other data showing areas of special flood hazard:

<P> (1) In areas where FEMA has not identified special flood hazard areas, or in FEMA identified special flood hazard areas where base flood elevation and floodway data have not been identified, the Floodplain Administrator shall review and reasonably utilize any other flood hazard data available from a federal, state, or other source.

<P> (2) Base flood elevations and floodway boundaries produced on FEMA flood maps and studies shall take precedence over base flood elevations and floodway boundaries by any other source that reflect a reduced floodway width and/or lower base flood elevations. Other sources of data, showing increased base flood elevations and/or larger floodway areas than are shown on FEMA flood maps and studies, shall be reasonably used by the Floodplain Administrator.

<P> (3) When Preliminary Flood Insurance Rate Maps and / or Flood Insurance Study have been provided by FEMA:

<P>  A. Upon the issuance of a Letter of Final Determination by the FEMA, the preliminary flood hazard data shall be used and replace all previously existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA for the purposes of administering these regulations. 

<P>  B. Prior to the issuance of a Letter of Final Determination by FEMA, the use of preliminary flood hazard data shall only be required where no base flood elevations and /or floodway areas exist or where the preliminary base flood elevations or floodway area exceed the base flood elevations and/or floodway widths in existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA. Such preliminary data may be subject to change and / or appeal to FEMA.

<P> (4) The Floodplain Administrator shall make interpretations, where needed, as to the exact location of the flood boundaries and areas of special flood hazard. A person contesting the determination of the location of the boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation as provided in Section <A HREF="586aa3ab.html">1448.05</A>, Appeals and Variances.

<P> (5) Where a map boundary showing an area of special flood hazard and field elevations disagree, the base flood elevations or flood protection elevations (as found on an elevation profile, floodway data table, established high water marks, <I>etc.</I>) shall prevail.

<P>(l) <U>Substantial Damage Determinations</U>. Damages to structures may result from a variety of causes including flood, tornado, wind, heavy snow, fire, <I>etc.</I> After such a damage event, the Floodplain Administrator shall:

<P> (1) Determine whether damaged structures are located in special flood hazard areas;

<P> (2) Conduct substantial damage determinations for damaged structures located in special flood hazard areas; and

<P> (3) Make reasonable attempt to notify owners of substantially damaged structures of the need to obtain a floodplain development permit prior to repair, rehabilitation, or reconstruction.

<P>Additionally, the Floodplain Administrator may implement other measures to assist with the substantial damage determination and subsequent repair process. These measures include issuing press releases, public service announcements, and other public information materials related to the floodplain development permits and repair of damaged structures; coordinating with other federal, state, and local agencies to assist with substantial damage determinations; providing owners of damaged structures materials and other information related to the proper repair of damaged structures in special flood hazard areas; and assist owners of substantially damaged structures with Increased Cost of Compliance insurance claims.
