<H1>1278.01 INTENT. </H1>

  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY> Within the districts established by this Zoning Code, as amended, there exist lots, structures, uses of land and/or structures and characteristics of use which were lawful before this Zoning Code was passed or amended, but which are prohibited, regulated or restricted under the provisions of this Zoning Code, as amended. With regard to most nonconformities, it is the intent of this chapter to permit them to continue until they are removed, but not to encourage their survival. It is further the intent of this chapter that most nonconformities shall not be enlarged upon, expanded, extended or used as grounds for adding other structures or uses prohibited elsewhere in the same district. However, it is also recognized that certain classes of nonconformities may present less severe conflicts with permitted uses, and some relief from these restrictions can be made conditionally available to the owners of such properties on an elective basis. (Ord. 99-20. Passed 5-6-99.)
