<H1>1272.11 PRIVACY.</H1>

<P>(a) Each PUD shall provide reasonable visual and acoustical privacy for dwelling units within the PUD and on parcels contiguous to the PUD. Fences, insulation, walls, barriers and landscaping shall be used, as appropriate, for the protection and aesthetic enhancement of property and the privacy of its occupants, the screening of objectionable views or uses and the reduction of noise. 

<P>(b) High-rise buildings shall be located within a PUD in such a way as to dissipate any adverse impact on adjoining low-rise buildings and shall not invade the privacy of the occupants of such low-rise buildings. In PUDs which are not primarily residential in character, these requirements may be relaxed as the Planning Commission finds appropriate. 

<P>(Ord. 02-4. Passed 1-17-02.)
