<P> (2) If the person is stopped for a law enforcement purpose and if the person is carrying a concealed handgun, knowingly fail to keep the person’s hands in plain sight at any time after any law enforcement officer begins approaching the person while stopped and before the law enforcement officer leaves, unless the failure is pursuant to and in accordance with directions given by a law enforcement officer;

<P>(c) (1) This section does not apply to any of the following:

<P>  A. An officer, agent or employee or this or any other state or the United States, or to a law enforcement officer, who is authorized to carry concealed weapons or dangerous ordnance, or is authorized to carry handguns and is acting within the scope of the officer’s, agent’s or employee’s duties;

<P>  B. Any person who is employed in this State, who is authorized to carry concealed weapons or dangerous ordnance or is authorized to carry handguns, and who is subject to and in compliance with the requirements of Ohio R.C. 109.801 unless the appointing authority of the person has expressly specified that the exemption provided in subsection (c)(1)B. hereof does not apply to the person.

<P>  C. A person’s transportation or storage of a firearm, other than a firearm described in divisions (G) to (M) of Ohio R.C. 2923.11 in a motor vehicle for any lawful purpose if the firearm is not, on the actor’s person;

<P>(d) It is an affirmative defense to a charge under subsection (a)(1) of this section of carrying or having control of a weapon other than a handgun and other than a dangerous ordnance, that the actor was not otherwise prohibited by law from having the weapon, and that any of the following applies:

<P> (1) The weapon was carried or kept ready at hand by the actor for defensive purposes, while the actor was engaged in or was going to or from the actor’s lawful business or occupation, which business or occupation was of a character or was necessarily carried on in a manner or at a time or place as to render the actor particularly susceptible to criminal attack, such as would justify a prudent person in going armed.

<P> (2) The weapon was carried or kept ready at hand by the actor for defensive purposes, while the actor was engaged in a lawful activity and had reasonable cause to fear a criminal attack upon the actor, a member of the actor’s family, or the actor’s home, such as would justify a prudent person in going armed.

<P> (3) The weapon was carried or kept ready at hand by the actor for any lawful purpose and while in the actor’s own home.

<P>(e) No person who is charged with a violation of this section shall be required to obtain a license or temporary emergency license to carry a concealed handgun under Ohio R.C. 2923.125 or 2923.1213 as a condition for the dismissal of the charge.

<P>(f) (1) Whoever violates this section is guilty of carrying concealed weapons. Except as otherwise provided in this subsection or subsection (f)(2) of this section, carrying concealed weapons in violation of subsection (a) of this section is a misdemeanor of the first degree. Except as otherwise provided in this subsection or subsection (f)(2) of this section, if the offender previously has been convicted of a violation of this section or of any offense of violence, if the weapon involved is a firearm that is either loaded or for which the offender has ammunition ready at hand, or if the weapon involved is dangerous ordnance, carrying concealed weapons in violation of subsection (a) of this section is a felony and shall be prosecuted under appropriate State law.

<P> (2) If a person being arrested for a violation of subsection (a)(2) of this section promptly produces a valid license or temporary emergency license issued under Ohio R.C. 2923.125 or 2923.1213 or a license to carry a concealed handgun that was issued by another state with which the Attorney General has entered into a reciprocity agreement under Ohio R.C. 109.69, and if at the time of the violation the person was not knowingly in a place described in division (B) of Ohio R.C. 2923.126, the officer shall not arrest the person for a violation of that subsection. If the person is not able to promptly produce any of those types of license and if the person is not in a place described in that section, the officer may arrest the person for a violation of that subsection, and the offender shall be punished as follows:

<P>  A. The offender shall be guilty of a minor misdemeanor if both of the following apply:

<P>   2. Within forty-five days after the arrest, the offender presents any type of license identified in subsection (f)(2)A.1. of this section to the law enforcement agency that employed the arresting officer, and the offender waives in writing the offender’s right to a speedy trial on the charge of the violation that is provided in Ohio R.C. 2945.71.

<P>   3. At the time of the commission of the offense, the offender was not knowingly in a place described in division (B) of Ohio R.C. 2923.126.

<P>  C. If neither subsection (f)(2)A. nor B. of this section applies, the offender shall be punished under subsection (f)(1) of this section.

<P> (3) Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, carrying concealed weapons in violation of subsection (b)(1) hereof is a misdemeanor of the first degree, and, in addition to any other penalty or sanction imposed for a violation of subsection (b)(1) hereof, the offender’s license or temporary emergency license to carry a concealed handgun shall be suspended pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2923.128.

<P>If, at the time of the stop of the offender for a law enforcement purpose that was the basis of the violation, any law enforcement officer involved with the stop had actual knowledge that the offender has been issued a license or temporary emergency license to carry a concealed handgun, carrying concealed weapons in violation of division (b)(1) of this section is a minor misdemeanor, and the offender’s license or temporary emergency license to carry a concealed handgun shall not be suspended pursuant to division (A)(2) of Ohio R.C. 2923.128.

<P> (4) Except as otherwise provided herein, carrying concealed weapons in violation of subsection (b)(2) or (b)(3) hereof is a misdemeanor of the first degree. If the offender has previously been convicted or pleaded guilty to a violation of Ohio R.C. 2923.12(B)(2) or (B)(4) or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, carrying concealed weapons is a felony and shall be prosecuted under appropriate state law. In addition to any other penalty or sanction imposed for a violation of subsection (b)(2) or (b)(3) hereof, the offender’s license or temporary emergency license to carry a concealed handgun shall be suspended pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2923.128(A)(2).

<P>(g) If a law enforcement officer stops a person to question the person regarding a possible violation of this section, for a traffic stop, or for any other law enforcement purpose, if the person surrenders a firearm to the officer, either voluntarily or pursuant to a request or demand of the officer, and if the officer does not charge the person with a violation of this section or arrest the person for any offense, the person is not otherwise prohibited by law from possessing the firearm, and the firearm is not contraband, the officer shall return the firearm to the person at the termination of the stop. If a court orders a law enforcement officer to return a firearm to a person pursuant to the requirement set forth in this subsection, division (B) of Ohio R.C. 2923.163 applies. (ORC 2923.12)
