<H1>606.08  ORGANIZATIONAL CRIMINAL LIABILITY.</H1>

  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY> (a) An organization may be convicted of an offense under any of the following circumstances:

  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>  (1) The offense is a minor misdemeanor committed by an officer, agent or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of the officer’s, agent’s or employee’s office or employment, except that if the section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.

  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>  (2) A purpose to impose organizational liability plainly appears in the section defining the offense, and the offense is committed by an officer, agent or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of the officer’s, agent’s or employee’s office or employment, except that if the section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.

  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>  (3) The offense consists of an omission to discharge a specific duty imposed by law on the organization.

  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>  (4) If, acting with the kind of culpability otherwise required for the commission of the offense, its commission was authorized, requested, commanded, tolerated or performed by the board of directors, trustees, partners or by a high managerial officer, agent or employee acting in behalf of the organization and within the scope of such a board’s or person’s office or employment.

  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY> (b) If strict liability is imposed for the commission of an offense, a purpose to impose organizational liability shall be presumed, unless the contrary plainly appears.

  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY> (c) In a prosecution of an organization for an offense other than one for which strict liability is imposed, it is a defense that the high managerial officer, agent or employee having supervisory responsibility over the subject matter of the offense exercised due diligence to prevent its commission. This defense is not available if it plainly appears inconsistent with the purpose of the section defining the offense.

  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY> (d) As used in this section, &quot;organization&quot; means a corporation for profit or not for profit, partnership, limited partnership, joint venture, unincorporated nonprofit association, estate, trust or other commercial or legal entity. &quot;Organization&quot; does not include an entity organized as or by a governmental agency for the execution of a governmental program.
