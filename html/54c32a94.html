<H1>1278.06  NONCONFORMING USES OF LAND.</H1>

  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>Where, at the time of the adoption of this Zoning Code (Ordinance 546B, passed February 25, 1976), a lawful use of land exists which is not permitted by this Zoning Code, and where such use involves no individual structure with a replacement cost exceeding one thousand dollars ($1,000), the use may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful provided that:

  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY> (a) No such nonconforming use shall be enlarged or increased or extended to occupy a greater area of land than was occupied on the effective date of adoption or amendment of this Zoning Code (Ordinance 546B, passed February 25, 1976).

  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY> (b) No such nonconforming use shall be moved in whole or in part to any portion of the lot or parcel other than that occupied by such use on the effective date of adoption or amendment of this Zoning Code (Ordinance 546B, passed February 25, 1976).

  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY> (c) If any such nonconforming use of land ceases for any reason for more than thirty days, any subsequent use of such land shall conform to the regulations of this Zoning Code for the district in which such land is located.

  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY> (d) No additional structure not conforming to this Zoning Code shall be erected in connection with such nonconforming use of land.

  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>  (Ord. 99-20. Passed 5-6-99.)
