<P>(a)  Where a public sanitary sewer is not available under the provisions of Section <A HREF="443da656.html">1044.02</A>(d), the building sewer shall be connected to a private sewage disposal system complying with this chapter. 

<P>(Ord. 923. Passed 12-18-80.) 

<P>(b)  Before the commencement of construction of a private sewage disposal system, the owner shall first obtain a written permit therefor from the Municipality. The application for such permit shall be made on a form furnished by the Municipality, a copy of which is attached to original Ordinance 923, passed December 18, 1980, which the applicant shall supplement with such plans, specifications and other information as are deemed necessary. A permit and inspection fee as set forth in Appendix A of Chapter <A HREF="58d37b9c.html">1464</A> of the Building and Housing Code of the Codified Ordinances shall be paid to the Municipality at the time the application is filed.

The Inspector shall be allowed to inspect the work at any stage of construction and, in any event, the applicant for the permit shall notify the Inspector when the work is ready for final inspection and before any underground portions are covered. The inspection shall be made within five working days of the receipt of notice by the Inspector. 

<P>(d)  The type, capacity, location and layout of a private sewage disposal system shall comply with all requirements of the State Environmental Protection Agency and the County Health Department and the regulations of the Municipality.

<P>(f)  The owner shall operate and maintain the private sewage disposal facility in a sanitary manner at all times, at no expense to the Municipality. 

<P>(g)  Nothing contained in this section shall be construed to interfere with any additional requirement that may be imposed by the County Health Officer.
