<P> (7) <U>Parking lot location</U>. For non-residential zoning districts&#151;including non- residential uses in an O-R, Office-Residential Zoning District&#151;no part of any parking lot or circulation aisle shall be closer than twenty feet (20’) to any dwelling, school, hospital or other institution for human care or habitation located on an adjacent zoning lot, unless screened according to the landscaping provisions of these regulations.

 (d) <U>Number of Parking Spaces Required.</U>

<P> (1) <U>Units of measure and means of off-street parking requirement calculation</U>. In computing the requirement for off-street parking spaces, the following units of measure shall be uses:

<P>  A. Whenever the number of off-street parking spaces required is determined by gross square feet of floor area, it shall be measured from the exterior surface of exterior walls or from the center line of walls separating buildings.

<P>  B. In the case of benches, pews and similar seating accommodations, each eighteen (18) inches thereof shall be counted as one (1) seat for the purpose of determining the parking requirements.

<P>  C. Where fractional spaces result, the parking spaces required shall be construed to be the nearest whole number.

<P>  D. In the case of mixed-use sites or shopping centers, the parking spaces required shall be five (5) parking spaces per one thousand (1,000) square feet.

<P>  E. Parking spaces designated for use by vehicle fleets shall not be credited to the parking requirement.

<P> (2) <U>Minimum off-street parking space requirements for specific land uses</U>. The minimum number of off-street parking spaces required shall be calculated using the Table 2 in this section:

  <I>Table 2. Minimum Parking Requirements.</I>

<P> (3) <U>Minimum off-street parking requirements for other land uses</U>. The minimum off-street parking space requirement for land uses not specifically identified in the table above shall be the same as the minimum off-street requirement for a use of a similar nature or as determined by the Director of Planning using references such as the Institute of Transportation Engineers “Parking Generation,” 3rd edition or its successor publication, or American Planning Association PAS Report 510/511 “Parking Standards” or its successor publication.

<P> (4) <U>Maximum off-street parking requirement</U>. The maximum off-street parking requirement shall be one hundred and fifty percent (150%) of the minimum identified in the table above. The provision of parking over the minimum requirement shall only be permitted when accompanied by an increased amount of landscaping as required as defined in the Landscaping section of these Supplemental Regulations.

<P>(e) <U>Other Provisions.</U>

<P> (1) <U>Allowance for Shared Parking</U>. The Planning Commission may accept a site plan that satisfies the off-street parking requirements by use of off- site shared parking with the City or another nonresidential user. In determining whether to accept the proposed site plan, the Planning Commission may consider the proximity and accessibility of the off-site location to the proposed development site, the hours of operation of both users, the number of spaces available and required for each business and the compatibility of uses. 

<P> (2) <U>Reduction of off-street parking requirements in certain circumstances.</U> Excluding parking for residential uses, the parking requirement for uses<B><U> </U></B>where on-street parking is provided on adjacent rights-of-way, may be reduced to fifty percent (50%) of the minimum requirement identified in subsection (d)(4) above.
