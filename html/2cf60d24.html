<P>The City, upon recommendation of the Chief Animal Control Officer may, for good cause, revoke any permit or modify any terms or provisions thereof and may, in the event it is reasonably necessary to protect against an immediate threat or danger to the public health or safety, suspend any permit or portion thereof without hearing, for a period not to exceed thirty (30) days. Failure to comply with any of the provisions of this chapter shall be sufficient grounds for revocation. (Ord. 90-2. Passed 1-4-90.)
