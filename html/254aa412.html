<P>(b) <U>Local Streets.</U> No person shall operate a vehicle exceeding a size as specified in Section <A HREF="255c099c.html">440.02</A> or exceeding a gross weight of five tons, upon any street in the Municipality other than State routes and County roads, except those local streets designated as a truck route and marked as such by appropriate traffic signs, and except when such operation is necessary to load or unload property, to go to or from the usual place of storage of such vehicle or to perform any other legitimate business or act other than passage through Municipality. Operators of vehicles so deviating from either a State route or a designated truck route within the Municipality shall confine such deviation to that required in order to accomplish the purpose of the departure. On County roads Council or other duly designated local authority shall establish reasonable weight limits commensurate with the construction and material specifications for such roads and the load resistance of such roads as determined by the County Engineer.

<P>(c) <U>Local Permit and Conditions.</U> Upon application and for good cause, the Police Chief may issue a local permit authorizing an applicant to move an oversize or overweight vehicle or combination of vehicles upon local streets and highways.

<P>No permittee shall be required to obtain a special permit from the Ohio Director of Transportation for the movement of the vehicle or combination of vehicles on streets or highways under local jurisdiction. However, the approval of the Ohio Director of Transportation shall be required for movement upon State routes as provided in subsection (a) hereof.

<P>The Police Chief may grant a permit for a single or round trip, or for such period of time, not to exceed one year, as the Police Chief in his discretion deems advisable, or for the duration of any construction project. The Police Chief may limit or prescribe terms or conditions of operation for such vehicle or combination of vehicles by designating the route, hours, speed or such other restrictions as may be necessary for the preservation of the public peace, property, health and safety. The Police Chief may require the posting of bond or other security necessary to compensate for any damage to a roadway or road structure.

<P>For each such permit, the Police Chief shall charge a fee as set forth in Appendix A of Chapter <A HREF="58d37b9c.html">1464</A> of the Building and Housing Code of the Codified Ordinances.

<P>Except as provided in subsections (a) and (b) hereof, streets and highways shall be posted with signs indicating “no thru trucks - gross weight 5 tons” or words of similar import to apprise drivers of the limitations imposed by this section. No driver shall disobey the instructions indicated on any such sign.

<P>Violation of any of the limitations, terms or conditions of the permit granted by the Police Chief shall be cause for immediate revocation or suspension of such permit and denial of request for any future permit.
