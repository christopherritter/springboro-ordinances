Such designation may be made only after a public hearing of City Council for the purpose of reviewing the recommendation and receiving the comments of interested parties. At least thirty days prior to said public hearing, notice shall be provided to the owner of each tree which has been recommended as a Monarch Tree by the Tree Authority. The notice shall state the purpose, time, date and place of the public hearing. Monarch Trees may be designated on either public or private property, including public property not controlled by the City.</FONT></TD>
