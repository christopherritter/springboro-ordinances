Their minimum paved roadway widths shall ordinarily be as delineated in the Subdivision Regulations and in the Thoroughfare Plan. However, approval of interior access streets with different nonstructural dimensions will be considered by the Planning Commission and Council where the developer can demonstrate compliance with Section <A HREF='5336b269.html?f=FifLink&amp;t=document-frame.htm&amp;l=jump&amp;iid=2708dbda.33f0517e.0.0&amp;nid=725#JD_127201'>1272.01 </A>and receive approval from the Municipal Engineer. Approval of the PUD with such differences will constitute lawful approval of a variance from the Subdivision Regulations.&nbsp; Where streets are not fully constructed in accord with the subdivision regulations and thoroughfare plan, such streets shall be privately owned and maintained, and shall be constructed entirely within a public access easement. All public access easements shall be designated on the general plan, the final development plan, and the record plan for each section of the development. </FONT></TD>
