Abandoned equipment is deemed to be a nuisance. The City may exercise any remedies or rights it has at law or in equity, including, but not limited to: (i) abating the nuisance; (ii) taking possession of the equipment and restoring it to a useable condition; or (iii) requiring removal of the equipment by the provider, or the provider's successor in interest.</FONT></TD>
