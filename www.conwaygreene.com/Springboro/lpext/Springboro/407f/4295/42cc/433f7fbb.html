  <TD><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT FACE='CG Times' SIZE=3>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;If a meter stops or fails to register or has become out of order between meter reading dates, an estimate of water consumed for the period shall be made by the Director of Service, such estimate to be based on the corresponding period of the preceding year or on the average established for such period. Water meters shall be purchased by the Director and shall remain the property of the Municipality at all times. Meters over four inches shall be handled as special cases by the Director. When any meter seal has been found broken from any cause, water service will be immediately turned off and will not be restored until a fee as set forth in Appendix A of Chapter <A HREF='../../../561c/5700/58d37b9c.html?f=FifLink&amp;t=document-frame.htm&amp;l=jump&amp;iid=2708dbda.33f0517e.0.0&amp;nid=83#JD_Ch1464'>1464</A> of the Building and Housing Code of the Codified Ordinances has been paid to the Director as liquidated damages. The payment of such sum may be waived by the Director. Meters damaged by misuse, frost, accident or any act of the consumer will be repaired or replaced by the Division of Water at the expense of the consumer. Meters shall be removed only by authorized personnel of the Division and no unauthorized person shall remove or tamper with water meters. The Division may remove a meter from a consumer's premises at any time and may substitute the same for the purpose of testing or repairing. The Division shall test any meter which, in the opinion of the consumer, is registering incorrectly. If the meter, upon such test, proves to be registering correctly, the consumer shall pay a charge as set forth in such Appendix A of Chapter <A HREF='../../../561c/5700/58d37b9c.html?f=FifLink&amp;t=document-frame.htm&amp;l=jump&amp;iid=2708dbda.33f0517e.0.0&amp;nid=83#JD_Ch1464'>1464</A> for such test. Meters shall be kept easily accessible to meter readers and other authorized personnel of the Division and no person shall permit a meter to become covered or obstructed by rubbish or other material. No person shall install a water meter in a coal cellar. Multiple service shall not be permitted unless specifically authorized by the Director. Water service provided by the Division shall not be resold by any consumer. </FONT></TD>
