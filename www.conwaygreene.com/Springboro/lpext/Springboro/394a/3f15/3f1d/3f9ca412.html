The returns shall be on a form or forms prescribed by or acceptable to the Administrator and shall be subject to the rules and regulations prescribed therefor by the Administrator.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Administrator may adopt rules and regulations allowing such tax return forms to be filed by electronic means.&nbsp; Effective January 1, 2005, every employer required to withhold the tax on compensation paid shall make payments of withheld tax electronically using one of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) methods prescribed by the Administrator, unless exemption from this requirement is given by the Administrator for cases in which such requirement would constitute a substantial hardship on the employer.&nbsp; Returns may be filed by an employer on a quarterly basis when the amount of a monthly return would normally be less than one hundred dollars ($100.00). Such employer shall be liable for the payment of the tax required to be deducted and withheld, whether or not such taxes have in fact been withheld.</FONT></TD>
