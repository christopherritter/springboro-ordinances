  <TD><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT FACE='CG Times' SIZE=3>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(a) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Whenever the County Board of Health ascertains from examination or reports of its inspectors or sanitary officers or otherwise that a public nuisance exists, as provided in Section <A HREF='372c6d5f.html?f=FifLink&amp;t=document-frame.htm&amp;l=jump&amp;iid=2708dbda.33f0517e.0.0&amp;nid=3bd#JD_66802'>668.02</A>, in or upon any structure, building or portion thereof, and is of the opinion that such nuisance is capable of being abated without immediate vacation of such structure, building or portion thereof, and serves notice upon the owner of such structure or building, or his or her lessee or agent, or the person in possession, charge or control thereof, directing such person to abate such nuisance and remove the unclean or unsanitary conditions within such reasonable time as may be fixed by the Board and specified in such notice, such person shall abate such nuisance within such time. Whenever such abatement does not take place within such time, or whenever, in the opinion of the Board, such abatement is impossible or impractical without an immediate vacation of such structure, building or portion thereof, and the Board serves notice upon such person to vacate or cause the vacation of such structure, building or portion thereof designated in the notice, then it shall be the duty of such person to vacate or cause the vacation of such structure, building or portion thereof within twenty days from the date of the service of such notice, or within a shorter time (not less than twenty-four hours in any case) as may be specified in such notice. Whenever, either in addition to or without the service of such notice on such person, the Board is of the opinion that such nuisance can be abated by a tenant or other occupant of such structure, building or portion thereof, and such notice, either for abatement of the nuisance or for vacation of the premises, is served upon such tenant or other occupant, then it shall be the duty of such tenant or other occupant to comply with the terms of such notice and to abate the nuisance or vacate the premises accordingly. After the receipt of any such notice, no person shall occupy or permit the occupancy of such premises or portion thereof until such nuisance has been completely abated and such structure, building or portion thereof has been rendered clean and sanitary in accordance with the terms of such notices of the Board of Health. When there is no owner, agent, lessee or person in charge, possession or control, who is a resident of or can be served in the Municipality, then personal service outside of the Municipality on any such owner, agent, lessee or person in charge, possession or control, by anyone delegated by the Board to make such service, or service by registered letter, or if the address of the owner, lessee, agent or person in possession, charge or control is unknown, or service is not secured by registered letter after effort to do so, then service by publication once a week for two consecutive weeks in any newspaper of general circulation in the Municipality, or by posting or attaching to or on the outside of such structure or building of a copy of the notice or order consecutively for two weeks, shall have the same effect as service within the Municipality.
