RESOLUTION NO. _____________________ 

A RESOLUTION AUTHORIZING THE CITY MANAGER TO ENTER INTO AN AGREEMENT FOR 
ELECTRIC GENERATION SUPPLY WITH A COMPETITIVE RETAIL ELECTRIC SERVICE PROVIDER 
WITHIN A REGIONAL PURCHASING GROUP PROGRAM. 

WHEREAS, the City is one of many municipalities currently eligible to participate in the Miami Valley Communications 
Council (“MVCC”) electric generation supply agreement for the provision of electric generation and transmission supply 
services; and 

WHEREAS, in accordance with the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio rules and regulations, the participating Municipalities 
have the opportunity to maximize savings on the generation and transmission portion of their electric service costs through the 
selection of a competitive retail electric service provider; and 

WHEREAS, the participating Municipalities desire to seek competitive pricing for a new electric generation and transmission 
supply service agreement (“Agreement”) for municipal accounts; and 

WHEREAS, the participating Municipalities desire to authorize MVCC and its Executive Director to act as procuring agents, 
along with any consultant utilized by MVCC (collectively, the “Procuring Agents”) to seek competitive pricing for electric 
generation and transmission supply services; and 

WHEREAS, time is of the essence in securing the best possible electric generation and transmission supply rates and the 
participating Municipalities will need to be able to sign a new Agreement immediately upon identifying the lowest and best 
competitive supplier due to market pricing requirements and deadlines; and 

WHEREAS, the participating Municipalities desire to authorize their respective City Managers to enter into a new Agreement 
with the lowest and best competitive supplier immediately after the Procuring Agents have identified and recommended such 
supplier; should it be the best bid and in the best interest of the Municipality to do so, as determined by the Municipality, 

NOW, THEREFORE, THE CITY OF SPRINGBORO HEREBY RESOLVES: 

SECTION I 

MVCC and its Executive Director, along with any consultant utilized by MVCC, are hereby authorized 
to act as Procuring Agents to identify a competitive retail electric service provider for electric generation 
and transmission supply services. However, nothing in this Resolution shall authorize such Procuring
Agents to contractually bind the City to accept or enter into an Agreement with any such service 
provider, or to otherwise bind the City. 

SECTION II 

The City Manager is hereby authorized to execute an Agreement and any other necessary documents on 
behalf of the City for electric generation and transmission supply services with a competitive retail 
electric service provider if so determined to do so.

SECTION III 

Because the participating Municipalities must be able to sign a new contract immediately upon 
identifying the lowest and best competitive supplier in order to secure such rate and leverage the buying 
power of the group, this Resolution shall take effect immediately upon its adoption.

SECTION IV 

This resolution shall be effective at the earliest date allowed by law.
