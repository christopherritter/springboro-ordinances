In granting any variance, the Board of Zoning Appeals may prescribe
appropriate conditions and safeguards in conformity with this Zoning
Code. A violation of any of such conditions and safeguards, when made a
part of the terms under which the variance is granted, shall be deemed a
violation of this Zoning Code, punishable under Section
[1262.99](4da6057d.html). Under no circumstances shall the Board grant a
variance to allow a use not permissible under this Zoning Code in the
district involved, or any use expressly or by implication prohibited by
this Zoning Code in such district.
