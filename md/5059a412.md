If, in accordance with this Zoning Code and Ohio R.C. Chapter 713,
changes are made in district boundaries or other matters portrayed on
the Official Zoning Map, such changes shall be entered on the Map
promptly after the amendment has been approved by Council, with an entry
on the Map indicating the ordinance number and the date of adoption. No
new authentication of the Map by the Mayor and Clerk shall be necessary
following such changes, the authorizing ordinance and map notations
being sufficient.
