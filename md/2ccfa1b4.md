​(a) No person under Section [618.51](2cbad659.html), shall allow such
animal to remain within the City unless and until he/she has first
secured a permit so to do and complies with all terms and conditions of
such permit; and, in addition thereto, such animal shall at all times be
so confined, controlled and restrained in such manner so the life, limb
or property of any person lawfully entering such premises shall not be
endangered.

​(b) Failure to obtain a permit when required by subsection (a) after
written notification by the Chief Animal Control Officer or his/her
authorized deputy shall be adequate grounds for such officer or deputy
to impound such animal until a permit is obtained. If no permit is
obtained within ten (10) days, such animal will be subject to summary
destruction.
