----------------

Ordinances and resolutions must be introduced in written or printed form
capable of being read if they are of general or permanent nature, grant
a franchise, create a right, involve the expenditure of money or levy of
a tax, provide for the purchase, lease, sale, or transfer of property.

Ordinances or resolutions of a general or permanent nature or for the
purposes set forth above are required to be read by title only, on three
different days, unless such readings are dispensed with by a vote of
five (5) members elected to the Council. When the requirement of reading
on three (3) different days is dispensed with by the required vote, only
one (1) reading is required and the ordinance or resolution may be
passed forthwith or at a subsequent meeting by the majority vote of
Council. (Amended 11-7-00.)
