approval by a majority of those voting on the question of its adoption.
Such amendment may be initiated either by a vote of at least five (5)
members of Council, or by petition to the Council signed by ten (10)

election held in the City.

​(b) Review. At the first meeting of the Council in January, 1984, and
every eight (8) years thereafter, Council shall appoint a Commission of

review the existing Charter and make such recommendations as it may see
fit for revision. The Commission shall submit its report to Council not
later than July 1 of the same year. Thereupon, the Council may take such
action as it deems warranted with respect to such recommendations.

​(c) Conflicting Amendments. In the event two (2) conflicting amendments
to the Charter are approved at the same election by a majority of the
