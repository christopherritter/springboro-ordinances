A license shall not be valid beyond the expiration date specified
therein and, unless otherwise provided, shall not extend beyond December
31 of the year issued, except that at any time after December 14,
licenses may be issued for the ensuing calendar year. Unless otherwise
specified, the full annual fee will be required of licensees
