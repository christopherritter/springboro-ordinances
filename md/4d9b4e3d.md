In lieu of payment of the park and playground fee required by Section
[1262.26](4d9758ea.html), Council, on recommendation of the Planning
Commission, may accept the dedication, for park and playground use, of
open space constituting a reasonable proportion of the gross acreage of
the subdivision that is reasonably proportionate in value to the fee,
suitably located and of adequate size. However, in no event shall the
aggregate value of such dedicated land be less than the equivalent park
and playground fee otherwise payable and computed in accordance with the
fee established by Council.
