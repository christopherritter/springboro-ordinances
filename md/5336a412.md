================

​(a) It is the intent of this chapter to accommodate creative and
imaginative planned unit developments (hereinafter referred to as PUD)
and to permit those innovations in the technology of land development
that are in the best interest of the City of Springboro, in situations
where conventional zoning is inappropriate or unduly restrictive. In
order to accomplish this intent, it is the purpose of a PUD District to
permit, in a carefully-designed development, a variety of uses and/or
dwelling types, and to permit the flexible spacing of lots and
buildings, the conservation of natural features of the landscape, the
provision of accessible and enjoyable open spaces, and the provision of
a necessary complement of community and neighborhood facilities.

(Ord. 02-4. Passed 1-17-02.)

​(b) The Planning Commission shall hear and determine all appeals from
orders, requirements, decisions or determinations, made by the
administrative department or administrative employees charged with the
enforcement and application of the zoning ordinances with respect to all
matters in a Planned Unit Development established under Chapter
[1272](53182510.html) of the Codified Ordinances of the City of
Springboro. (Ord. 12-43. Passed 10-4-12.)
