202.06 CONFLICTING PROVISIONS.
==============================

​(a) If there is a conflict between figures and words in expressing a
number, the words govern.

(ORC 1.46)

​(b) If a general provision conflicts with a special or local provision,
they shall be construed, if possible, so that effect is given to both.
If the conflict between the provisions is irreconcilable, the special or
local provision prevails as an exception to the general provision,
unless the general provision is the later adoption and the manifest
intent is that the general provision prevail.

(ORC 1.51)

​(c) (1) If ordinances enacted at different meetings of Council are
irreconcilable, the ordinance latest in date of enactment prevails.

​(2) If amendments to the same ordinance are enacted at different
meetings of Council, one amendment without reference to another, the
amendments are to be harmonized, if possible, so that effect may be
given to each. If the amendments are substantively irreconcilable, the
latest in date of enactment prevails. The fact that a later amendment
restates language deleted by an earlier amendment, or fails to include
language inserted by an earlier amendment, does not of itself make the
amendments irreconcilable. Amendments are irreconcilable only when
changes made by each cannot reasonably be put into simultaneous
operation.
