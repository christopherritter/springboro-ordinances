title: 826.19 SIGNS ASSOCIATED WITH NONCONFORMING LAND USES.---

{{ page.title }}
----------------

In the case of lawfully nonconforming land uses (such as a business
located in an area later zoned residential), the allowable message area
shall be that which would be in effect if the existing use were located
in the most restrictive zoning district allowing such land use. Further,
no new signs associated with nonconforming land uses shall be erected,
except replacements which are the same or smaller in size than the sign
being replaced. In the event that a sign associated with a nonconforming
land use is moved or replaced, its new location must conform to the
setback requirements of the district in which it is located, as if it
were a building. If a legal nonconforming land use is discontinued for
more than six months, all signs associated with the discontinued use
shall be deemed obsolete.
