----------------

The Planning Commission shall approve, modify and approve, or deny an
application for approval of a final development plan within a reasonable
time after the date of such application. Upon approval of the final
development plan by the Commission, the Commission shall:

​(a) Furnish the developer with written notice of approval;

​(b) Authorize the issuance of a zoning certificate for each structure
indicated in the approved final development plan; and

​(c) See to it that the final development plan is recorded. Record the
final development plan with specific reference to the approved general
plan. Approval of a final development plan does not obligate the City
Council to approve the record plan. Planning Commission approval of a
final development plan is a necessary precondition to consideration and
approval of a record plan.
