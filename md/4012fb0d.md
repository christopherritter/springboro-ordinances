If any sentence, clause, section or part of this chapter, or any tax
against a person or any of the several groups specified herein, is found
to be unconstitutional, illegal or invalid, such unconstitutionality,

section or part of this chapter and shall not affect or impair any of

or invalid sentence, clause, section or part of this chapter not been
included herein. (Ord. 731. Passed 6-1-78.)
