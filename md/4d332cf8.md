NONCONFORMING USES.
---

{{ page.title }}
----------------

No person shall maintain, renew, change or extend a nonconforming
structure or use without first obtaining a zoning certificate therefor
from the Building and Zoning Inspector. The zoning certificate shall
state specifically wherein the nonconforming use differs from the
provisions of this Zoning Code, provided that upon enactment or
amendment of this Zoning Code, the owners or occupants of nonconforming
uses or structures shall have six months to apply for zoning
certificates. Failure to make such application within six months shall
be presumptive evidence that the property was in conforming use at the
time of enactment or amendment of this Zoning Code.

(Ord. 546B. Passed 2-25-76.)
