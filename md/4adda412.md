1246.06 DEFERRAL OF REQUIRED IMPROVEMENTS.
==========================================

​(a) The Planning Commission may defer or waive at the time of record
plan approval, subject to appropriate conditions, the provision of any
or all public improvements as, in its judgment, are not requisite in the
interests of the public health, safety, and general welfare, or which
are inappropriate because of the inadequacy or inexistence of connecting
facilities. Any determination to defer or waive the provision of any
public improvement must be made on the record and the reasons for the
deferral or waiver also shall be expressly made on the record.\\

​(b) Whenever it is deemed necessary by the City to defer the
construction of any improvement required under these regulations because
of incompatible grades, future planning, inadequate or nonexistent
connecting facilities, or for other reasons, the subdivider shall pay
his share of the costs of the future improvements to the local
government prior to signing of the record plans by the City, or the
developer may execute a separate subdivision improvement agreement
secured by a bond or cash escrow guaranteeing completion of the deferred
improvements upon demand of the local government.
