618.56 SEIZURE AND IMPOUNDING OF DANGEROUS ANIMALS.
===================================================

The Chief Animal Control Officer or his/her authorized deputy shall
forthwith cause to be seized and impounded any dangerous animal, where
the person owning, keeping or harboring such animal has failed to comply
with the notice sent pursuant to Section [618.55](2cc602a9.html). Upon
seizure and impoundment, such animal shall be delivered to a place of
confinement which may be with any organization which is authorized by
law to accept, own, keep or harbor such animals.

If, during the course of seizing and impounding any such animal, the
animal poses a risk of serious physical harm or death to any person,
such person or persons authorized by the Chief Animal Control Officer
may render such animal immobile by means of tranquilizers or other safe
drugs; or if it is not safely possible, then such animal may be killed.
