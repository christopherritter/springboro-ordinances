================

The prima-facie speed limitations set forth in Section
[434.03](21576109.html) do not apply to emergency vehicles or public
safety vehicles when they are responding to emergency calls and are
equipped with and displaying at least one flashing, rotating or
oscillating light visible under normal atmospheric conditions from a
distance of 500 feet to the front of the vehicle and when the drivers
thereof sound audible signals by bell, siren or exhaust whistle. This
section does not relieve the driver of an emergency vehicle or public
safety vehicle from the duty to drive with due regard for the safety of
all persons using the street or highway. (ORC 4511.24)
