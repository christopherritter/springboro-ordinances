{{ page.title }}
================

​(a) Each permit shall expire one year from the date of issuance and may
be renewed only by making application as provided in Section
[840.10](3cfb9fda.html) (for renewals, filing of original survey shall
be sufficient). Application for renewal shall be made at least thirty
days before the expiration date, and when made less than thirty days
before the expiration date, the expiration of the permit will not be
affected.

​(b) When the Director of Department of Police or his/her designee,
denies renewal of the permit, the applicant shall not be issued a permit
under this chapter for one year from the date of denial. If, subsequent
to denial, the City or its designee, finds that the basis for denial of
the renewal of the permit has been corrected, the applicant shall be
granted a permit if at least ninety days have elapsed since-the date
denial became final.

(Ord. 96-20. Passed 3-7-96.)
