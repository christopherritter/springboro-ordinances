----------------

​(a) The purpose of the A-1 District is to provide land which is
suitable or used for agricultural, conservation, very low density
residential, public and quasipublic purposes. Very low density
residential land use refers to farm housing units and isolated
residential developments not requiring a plat under the Subdivision
Regulations. It is further the purpose of the A-1 District to discourage
the scattering of residential subdivisions and commercial or industrial
development. On-site water and sewer facilities are permitted, provided
such facilities comply with the County health regulations.

(Ord. 546B. Passed 2-25-76.)

​(b) Nothing contained in this section shall prohibit the use of any
land, five acres or more, for agricultural purposes or the construction
or use of any building or structure incidental to such agricultural use,
and no zoning certificate shall be required for any such agricultural
use, building or structure so long as any building or structure used to
house farm animals or poultry is located at least 100 feet from
residentially zoned and developed land.

(Ord. 660. Passed 8-18-77.)
