================

To obtain information regarding the PUD approval process, requirements,
and other information relative to the PUD application, each applicant is
highly encouraged to engage in informal consultations with the Planning
Commission or its designated officer prior to filing an application. The
applicant should be prepared to discuss the general concept of the PUD,
with a conceptual plan. Thereafter, the Planning Commission or its
designated officer shall furnish the applicant with written comments
regarding such conference, including appropriate recommendations to
inform and assist the applicant prior to his or her preparation of the
components of the PUD zoning application. It is not required that a
person requesting a preapplication conference be a legal owner or holder
of an equitable interest in the subject property.
