{{ page.title }}
================

​(a) No vehicle shall be driven to the left of the center of the roadway
in overtaking and passing traffic proceeding in the same direction,
unless such left side is clearly visible and is free of oncoming traffic
for a sufficient distance ahead to permit such overtaking and passing to
be completely made, without interfering with the safe operation of any
traffic approaching from the opposite direction or any traffic
overtaken. In every event the overtaking vehicle must return to an
authorized lane of travel as soon as practicable and in the event the
passing movement involves the use of a lane authorized for traffic
approaching from the opposite direction before coming within 200 feet of
any approaching vehicle.

​(b) Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, whoever violates
this section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor. If, within one year of
the offense, the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded
guilty to one predicate motor vehicle or traffic offense, whoever
violates this section is guilty of a misdemeanor of the fourth degree.
If, within one year of the offense, the offender previously has been
convicted of two or more predicate motor vehicle or traffic offenses,
whoever violates this section is guilty of a misdemeanor of the third
degree.
