452.01 PROHIBITION AGAINST PARKING ON STREETS OR HIGHWAYS.
==========================================================

Upon any street or highway outside a business or residence district, no
person shall stop, park or leave standing any vehicle, whether attended
or unattended, upon the paved or main traveled part of the street or
highway if it is practicable to stop, park or so leave such vehicle off
the paved or main traveled part of such street or highway. In every
event, a clear and unobstructed portion of the street or highway
opposite such standing vehicle shall be left for the free passage of
other vehicles, and a clear view of such stopped vehicle shall be
available from a distance of 200 feet in each direction upon such street
or highway.

This section does not apply to the driver of any vehicle which is
disabled while on the paved or improved or main traveled portion of a
street or highway in such manner and to such extent that it is
impossible to avoid stopping and temporarily leaving the disabled
vehicle in such position.
