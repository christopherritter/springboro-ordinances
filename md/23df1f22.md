================

​(a) Whenever motor and other vehicles are operated in combination
during the time that lights are required, any light, except tail lights,
which by reason of its location on a vehicle of the combination would be
obscured by another vehicle of the combination need not be lighted, but
this section does not affect the requirement that lighted clearance
lights be displayed on the front of the foremost vehicle required to
have clearance lights or that all lights required on the rear of the
rearmost vehicle of any combination shall be lighted.

​(b) Whoever violates this section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor on a
first offense; on a second offense within one year after the first
offense, the person is guilty of a misdemeanor of the fourth degree; on
each subsequent offense within one year after the first offense, the
person is guilty of a misdemeanor of the third degree.
