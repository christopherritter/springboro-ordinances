================

At any time after preliminary plan approval and before submission of a
final plan, the applicant may request of the Director of Planning that
an amendment is made in the approval or conditional approval of the
preliminary plan. Under regulations established by the Planning
Commission, the Director of Planning may agree to proposed amendments
that are deemed to be minor. If the proposed amendment is major, the
Planning Commission shall follow the same requirements for preliminary
plan approval found in Section [1464.04](4a4745af.html) of the codified
ordinances of the City of Springboro shall accompany the proposed
subdivision amendment.
