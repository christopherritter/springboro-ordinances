in Section [668.03](37312874.html), without a previous notice of
abatement, such notice of vacation shall not be enforced as provided in
this chapter unless it specifies a time, not less than five days after
the service thereof, when the person so notified may appear before the
Board issuing the same to show cause why such notice should not be
enforced, and unless the Board, or a majority thereof, is present at its
office at the time so specified, provided that when, in the opinion of
at least four-fifths of the members of the Board, an emergency exists
which requires, for the protection of the health of occupants, the
vacation of the building or portion thereof without a delay of five
days, then no such fixing of a time for hearing shall be required. (1977
Code Sec. 94.08)
