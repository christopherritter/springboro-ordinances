Upon receipt of notice from a VSP that it will begin providing video
service in the City pursuant to a VSA, the City Manager or his/her
designee is authorized and directed to provide such VSP with notice that
the VSP shall be required to provide the same number of PEG channels in
the City under the same service tier conditions and subject to the same
channel reclamation conditions as may be proscribed by Ohio R.C.
1332.30(A)(1)(a-b) for the Incumbent Cable Provider with the most recent
obligation in the City, which notice shall be delivered in a manner that
provides for proof of timely delivery and shall state the appropriate
number of PEG channels and service tiers required to be provided by the
VSP within the City within 120 days after delivery of such notice.
Additionally, should no PEG channels currently be provided by an
Incumbent Cable Provider with such an obligation in the City, the City
Manager may provide written notice to a VSP of its obligation to provide
PEG channels in accordance with Ohio R.C. 1332.30(B)(1).
