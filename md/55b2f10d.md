{{ page.title }}
----------------

Minor changes to an approved site plan may be approved by a writing
endorsed by the City Engineer if such changes are clearly consistent
with the purposes and character of the approved site plan and are in
conformance with this chapter and with all other Municipal ordinances
and laws. Major changes and changes where consistency with the approved
plan is not clear to the City Engineer are subject to the procedural
requirements of this chapter in the same manner as an entirely new plan.
All applications for modifications to an approved site plan shall be
filed with the City Engineer in the same format as an original site plan
filing, to the extent applicable.

(Ord. 00-16. Passed 2-17-00.)
