{{ page.title }}
----------------

​(a) Before water service through existing lines may be obtained for any
residential unit within the Municipality, the owner of the premises
shall make application for such service to the Director of Service or
his or her designee.

​(b) Each owner shall deposit a water and sewer service deposit fee as
set forth in Appendix A of Chapter [1464](58d37b9c.html) of the Codified
Ordinances for each residential unit for which water service is to be
supplied. Such deposit shall be for the purpose of ensuring the payment
for water service rendered. The depositor shall receive no interest on
his or her deposit. The moneys so deposited shall be placed in a
separate fund to be used for no purpose other than to offset any unpaid
amounts for water service rendered. Such deposit shall not relieve the
depositor of the responsibility for payment for such service in excess
of the deposit.

​(c) Each owner of the premises to which water service is rendered who
has made the deposit, as set forth in this section, shall be entitled to
the refund of his or her deposit at such time as he or she has made
timely payment of all charges for water service for two years, or upon
termination of water service. A refund shall be made only upon written
application therefor.
