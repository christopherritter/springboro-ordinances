Any person charged with a violation of any provision of this chapter for
which payment of a prescribed fine may be made, may pay such sum in the
manner prescribed on the issued traffic ticket. Such payment shall be
deemed a plea of guilty, waiver of court appearance and acknowledgment
of conviction of the alleged offense and may be accepted in full
satisfaction of the prescribed penalty for such alleged violation.
Payment of the prescribed fine need not be accepted when laws prescribe
that a certain number of such offenses may require court appearance.
