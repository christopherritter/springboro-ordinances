Whenever the County Board of Health certifies to the Law Director any
failure to comply with any notice issued pursuant to Section
[668.03](37312874.html), with the request that civil proceedings for the
enforcement thereof be instituted, the Law Director shall institute any
and all proceedings, either legal or equitable, that may be appropriate
or necessary for the enforcement of such notice and the abatement of the
nuisance against which such notice was directed, such suits or
proceedings to be brought in the name of the Municipality. Proceedings
under this section shall not relieve any party defendant from criminal
prosecution or punishment under these Codified Ordinances or any other
criminal law or ordinance in force within the Municipality.
