{{ page.title }}
================

On any nonconforming structure or portion of a structure containing a
nonconforming use, work may be done in any period of twelve consecutive
months on ordinary repairs, or on the repair or replacement of
nonbearing walls, fixtures, wiring or plumbing, to an extent not
exceeding ten percent of the current replacement cost of the
nonconforming structure or nonconforming portion of the structure, as
the case may be, provided that the cubic content existing when it
becomes nonconforming shall not be increased. If a nonconforming
structure or portion of a structure containing a nonconforming use
becomes physically unsafe or unlawful due to lack of repairs and
maintenance, and it is declared by a duly authorized official to be
unsafe or unlawful by reason of physical condition, it shall not
thereafter be restored, repaired or rebuilt except in conformity with
the regulations of the district in which it is located. Nothing in this
Zoning Code shall be deemed to prevent the strengthening or restoring to
a safe condition of any building or part thereof declared to be unsafe
by any official charged with protecting the public safety, upon order of
such official.
