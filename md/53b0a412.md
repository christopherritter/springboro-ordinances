{{ page.title }}
----------------

Effective erosion and sedimentation controls shall be planned and
applied according to the following principles:

​(a) The smallest practical area of land should be exposed at any one
time during development.

​(b) When land is exposed during development, the exposure should be
kept to the shortest practical period of time.

​(c) Temporary vegetation and/or mulching shall be used to protect
critical areas exposed during development.

​(d) Sediment basins (debris basins or silt traps) shall be installed
and maintained to remove sediment from run-off waters from land
undergoing development.

​(e) Provisions shall be made to accommodate the increased run-off
caused by changed soil and surface conditions during and after
development.

​(f) Permanent final vegetation and structures shall be installed as
soon as practical in the development.

​(g) The development shall be fitted to the topography and soils so as
to create the least erosion potential.

​(h) Wherever feasible, natural vegetation should be retained and
protected. Development of the PUD must conform to the municipal tree
ordinance.
