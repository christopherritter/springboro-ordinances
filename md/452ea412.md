If charges for service are not paid within thirty days after the bill is
rendered then such service charges shall be deemed and are hereby
declared to be delinquent. Thereafter, such delinquent charges shall
constitute a lien upon the real estate for which such sewer services
were supplied and shall be certified to the County Auditor for
collection. If charges are not paid within forty-five days, the
Municipality may discontinue service after ten days notice. Charges
accruing under the provisions of Sections [1044.14](44cbbcd4.html) are
collectible by the City or its authorized agent along with reasonable
administrative costs thereon by other means. Reasonable administrative
costs associated with the collection of delinquent utility bills include
but are not limited to, fees in an amount up to an additional fifty
percent (50%) of the total delinquent amount, including the tax amount,
interest and penalties of any post judgment account assigned to a
collection agency. (Ord. 10-27. Passed 6-17-10.)
