​(a) All three-quarter inch (or less) residential water meters shall be
purchased from the Municipality and installed by the Municipality. A
water meter setting fee shall also be applied as set forth in Appendix A
of Chapter [1464](58d37b9c.html) of the Codified Ordinances.

​(b) The original purchase of a meter over three-fourths of an inch
shall be made by the consumer. After the meter has been installed and
placed in service, the Division of Water will assume the maintenance of
the meter or its replacement, without charge to the consumer. In cases
of damage by freezing, hot water or other neglect on the part of the
consumer, the cost of repairs to or replacement of such meter shall then
be charged to the consumer.

​(c) The supply of water through each separate water branch shall be
recorded by one meter only, provided that more than one meter will be
permitted on a branch to separate commercial consumption from domestic
consumption, where the uses are under one roof.
