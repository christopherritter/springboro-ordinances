​(a) Every motor vehicle, trailer, semitrailer, pole trailer or vehicle
which is being drawn at the end of a train of vehicles shall be equipped
with at least one tail light mounted on the rear which, when lighted,
shall emit a red light visible from a distance of 500 feet to the rear,
provided that in the case of a train of vehicles only the tail light on
the rear-most vehicle need be visible from the distance specified.

placed as to illuminate with a white light the rear registration plate,
when such registration plate is required, and render it legible from a
distance of fifty feet to the rear. Any tail light, together with any
separate light for illuminating the rear registration plate, shall be so
wired as to be lighted whenever the headlights or auxiliary driving
lights are lighted, except where separate lighting systems are provided
for trailers for the purpose of illuminating such registration plate.

​(c) Whoever violates this section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor.
