Within the districts established by this Zoning Code, as amended, there
exist lots, structures, uses of land and/or structures and
characteristics of use which were lawful before this Zoning Code was
passed or amended, but which are prohibited, regulated or restricted
under the provisions of this Zoning Code, as amended. With regard to
most nonconformities, it is the intent of this chapter to permit them to
continue until they are removed, but not to encourage their survival. It
is further the intent of this chapter that most nonconformities shall
not be enlarged upon, expanded, extended or used as grounds for adding
other structures or uses prohibited elsewhere in the same district.
However, it is also recognized that certain classes of nonconformities
may present less severe conflicts with permitted uses, and some relief
from these restrictions can be made conditionally available to the
owners of such properties on an elective basis. (Ord. 99-20. Passed
5-6-99.)
