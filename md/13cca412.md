Section 6.03 Acting Manager.
============================

By letter filed with the Clerk of Council, the Manager shall designate a
qualified City administrative officer to exercise the powers and perform
the duties of Manager during temporary absence or disability. If such
designation has not been made, and the Manager is, in the opinion of the
majority vote of Council, unable to perform the Manager's duties or to
make such designation, the Council shall, by resolution, appoint any
qualified person, to perform the duties of the Manager, until the
Manager shall return or the Manager's disability ceases. During such
absence or disability, the Council may revoke such designation at any
time and appoint another officer of the City to serve until the Manager
shall return or the Manager's disability shall cease. (Amended 11-4-08.)
