It is the intent of this Zoning Code that all questions of
interpretation and enforcement shall be first presented to the Board of
Zoning Appeals only on appeals from the decisions of the Building and
Zoning Inspector, and that recourse from the decisions of the Board
shall be to the courts, as provided by law. It is further the intent of
this Zoning Code that the duties of Council in connection with this
Zoning Code shall not include hearing and deciding questions of
interpretation and enforcement that may arise. The procedure for
deciding such questions shall be as stated in this section and this
Zoning Code. Under this Zoning Code, Council shall have only the duties
of considering and adopting or rejecting proposed amendments or the
repeal of this Zoning Code as provided by law, and of establishing a
schedule of fees and charges as stated in Section
[1262.24](4d90de88.html). (Ord. 546B. Passed 2-25-76.)
