----------------

Collector streets and major thoroughfares shall be designated as such by
the developer upon the submission of general plans as provided in
Section [1272.14](53c36b10.html). Such designations shall be subject to
modification by the Planning Commission so that an efficient circulation
system is established in relation to other existing or planned streets
in the area. There shall be no direct access from single-family
residential lots to a major thoroughfare, and direct access from
single-family residential lots to collector streets shall be minimized.
