​(a) In addition to any other lawful requirements of load distribution,
no person shall operate any vehicle upon a street or highway unless such
vehicle is so laden as to prevent its contents from shifting or
otherwise unbalancing the vehicle to such an extent as to interfere with
the safe operation of the same.

​(b) No motor vehicle or trailer shall be driven unless the tailboard or
tailgate, tarpaulins, chains (except ground or contact chains), ropes,
stakes, poles, and the like, or any part of the load, are securely
fastened to prevent dangling, flapping, swinging or falling from the
side, end or top of the load or body. All projecting cargo shall be
properly guarded by a red flag or cloth or a red light or lantern as
required by Section [438.08.](23e5ce8d.html)

​(c) Whoever violates this section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor on a
first offense; on a second offense within one year after the first
offense, the person is guilty of a misdemeanor of the fourth degree; on
each subsequent offense within one year after the first offense, the
person is guilty of a misdemeanor of the third degree.
