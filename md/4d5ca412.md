{{ page.title }}
================

An appeal stays all proceedings in furtherance of the action appealed
from, unless the deputy building and zoning inspector, from whom the
appeal is taken, certifies to the Board of Zoning Appeals, after the
notice of appeal is filed with him or her, that by reason of facts
stated in the certificate, a stay would, in his or her opinion, cause
imminent peril to life and property. In such case, proceedings shall not
be stayed other than by a restraining order which may be granted by the
Board or by a court of record on application, on notice to the inspector
from whom the appeal is taken and on due cause shown.

(Ord. 546B. Passed 2-25-76.)
