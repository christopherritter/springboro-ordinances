No land or building in any district shall be used or occupied in any
manner so as to create a dangerous, injurious, noxious or otherwise
objectionable element or condition so as to adversely affect the
surrounding area or adjoining premises, provided that any use permitted
by this Zoning Code may be undertaken and maintained if acceptable
measures and safeguards are employed to limit dangerous and
objectionable elements to acceptable limits as established by the
performance requirements in Sections [1270.32.](512dadea.html) All
building permits for utilities and commercial and industrial uses will

will be controlled in accordance with the laws, rules and regulations
promulgated by the State and its agencies.
