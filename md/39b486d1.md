----------------

If an applicant has been denied a license, or if his or her license has
been revoked or suspended, the applicant or licensee, as the case may
be, shall, within three business days, have the right to appeal to
Council from such denial, revocation or suspension. Notice of appeal
shall be filed in writing with the Chief of Police who shall fix the
time and place for hearing, the same to be not later than one week
thereafter. The Chief shall notify the Manager and all members of
Council of the time and place of such hearing not less than twelve hours
in advance thereof. Three members of Council shall constitute a quorum
to hear such appeal. The appellant may appear and be heard in person or
by counsel. If, after hearing, a majority of the members of Council
present at such meeting declare in favor of the applicant, such license
shall be forthwith issued or fully reinstated, as the case may be;
otherwise, the order appealed from shall become final.
