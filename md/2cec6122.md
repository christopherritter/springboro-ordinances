----------------

The Chief Animal Control Officer may, following the application for a
permit and pending a final disposition of the same, grant a temporary
permit for the maintenance within the City of any such animal upon such
conditions as he/she shall, in his/her sole discretion, require when, in
his/her opinion, there is no reasonable doubt as to the consistency
thereof with the public health, safety and general welfare, but no such
animal shall be otherwise kept or maintained within this City or
permitted to occupy any premises within this City except while such a
regular or temporary permit is in full force and effect; provided,
however, that any law enforcement officer of the Chief Animal Control
Officer, or his authorized deputy, shall take possession of any animal
described under Section [618.51](2cae7fea.html) for which a permit has
not been issued and keep the same until the proper permit has been
secured by the owner or keeper thereof and shall release the same to the
owner or keeper when all fees and costs have been paid and all laws and
permit conditions complied with.
