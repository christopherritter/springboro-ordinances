----------------

In addition to the financial sanctions authorized or required under Ohio
R.C. 2929.18 and 2929.28 and to any costs otherwise authorized or
required under any provision of law, the court imposing sentence upon an
offender who is convicted of or pleads guilty to a drug abuse offense
may order the offender to pay to the state, municipal, or county law
enforcement agencies that handled the investigation and prosecution all
of the costs that the state, municipal corporation, or county reasonably
incurred in having tests performed under Ohio R.C. 2925.51, or in any
other manner on any substance that was the basis of, or involved in, the
offense to determine whether the substance contained any amount of a
controlled substance if the results of the tests indicate that the
substance tested contained any controlled substance. No court shall
order an offender under this section to pay the costs of tests performed
on a substance if the results of the tests do not indicate that the
substance tested contained any controlled substance.

The court shall hold a hearing to determine the amount of costs to be
imposed under this section. The court may hold the hearing as part of
the sentencing hearing for the offender.
