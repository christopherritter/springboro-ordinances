​(a) Every motor vehicle, trailer, semitrailer, and pole trailer when
operated upon a street or highway shall be equipped with two or more
stop lights, except that passenger cars manufactured or assembled prior
to January 1, 1967, motorcycles, and motor-driven cycles shall be
equipped with at least one stop light. Stop lights shall be mounted on
the rear of the vehicle, actuated upon application of the service brake,
and may be incorporated with other rear lights. Such stop lights when
actuated shall emit a red light visible from a distance of five hundred
feet to the rear, provided that in the case of a train of vehicles only
the stop lights on the rear-most vehicle need be visible from the
distance specified.

Such stop lights when actuated shall give a steady warning light to the
rear of a vehicle or train of vehicles to indicate the intention of the
operator to diminish the speed of or stop a vehicle or train of
vehicles.

When stop lights are used as required by this section, they shall be
constructed or installed so as to provide adequate and reliable
illumination and shall conform to the appropriate rules and regulations
established under Ohio R.C. 4513.19.

Historical motor vehicles as defined in Ohio R.C. 4503.181, not
originally manufactured with stop lights, are not subject to this
section.

​(b) Whoever violates this section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor.
