{{ page.title }}
----------------

In any Residential District abutting or adjacent to an R-1 District, the
minimum lot size allowed for any lot directly adjacent to the R-1
District shall be the same as that required by the R-1 District. This
restriction does not apply to any lots of record existing as of the
effective date of this section (Ordinance 639, passed May 5, 1977), or
to any area where a preliminary plan has been approved by the
Municipality prior to the effective date of this section (Ordinance 639,
passed May 5, 1977). In special cases, where either natural buffers
exist or are created by the owners of adjacent properties, the Planning
Commission may waive this requirement.

(Ord. 639. Passed 5-5-77.)
