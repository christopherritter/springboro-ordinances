​(a) No person, acting with the kind of culpability required for the
commission of an offense, shall do any of the following:

​(1) Solicit or procure another to commit the offense;

​(2) Aid or abet another in committing the offense;

​(3) Cause an innocent or irresponsible person to commit the offense.

​(b) It is no defense to a charge under this section that no person with
whom the accused was in complicity has been convicted as a principal
offender.

​(c) No person shall be convicted of complicity under this section
unless an offense is actually committed, but a person may be convicted
of complicity in an attempt to commit an offense in violation of Section
[606.21](2a5501ab.html).

​(d) If an alleged accomplice of the defendant testifies against the
defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged with complicity in
the commission of or an attempt to commit an offense, an attempt to
commit an offense or an offense, the court when it charges the jury,
shall state substantially the following:

"The testimony of an accomplice does not become

inadmissible because of his complicity, moral turpitude

or self-interest, but the admitted or claimed complicity

of a witness may affect his credibility and make his

testimony subject to grave suspicion, and require that

it be weighed with great caution.

"It is for you, as jurors, in the light of all the facts presented to
you from the witness stand, to evaluate such testimony and to determine
its quality and worth or its lack of quality and worth."

​(e) It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that,
prior to the commission of or attempt to commit the offense, the actor
terminated his complicity, under circumstances manifesting a complete
and voluntary renunciation of his criminal purpose.

​(f) Whoever violates this section is guilty of complicity in the
commission of an offense, and shall be prosecuted and punished as if he
were a principal offender. A charge of complicity may be stated in terms
of this section, or in terms of the principal offense.
