The Council may determine the annual salary of Council Members by
ordinance, but no ordinance increasing such salaries shall become
effective until the commencement of the terms of Council Members elected
at the next regular election, provided that such election follows the
adoption of such ordinance by at least six (6) months. Contributions to
the Public Employees Retirement System for Council members shall be made
in the same manner as for all regular, full-time City employees. The
Mayor shall receive additional compensation. Council Members, by
resolution of Council, stating the exact purpose of the appropriation,
may receive their actual and necessary expenses incurred in the
performance of their duties of office.
