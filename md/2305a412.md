The person charged with a violation of subsection (a) or (b) of this section may offer evidence to rebut this prima-facie evidence.

(d) Whoever violates subsection (a) of this section is guilty of driving under financial responsibility law suspension or cancellation and shall be punished as provided in subsection (d) hereof. Whoever violates subsection (b) of this section is guilty of driving under a nonpayment of judgment suspension and shall be punished as provided in subsection (d) hereof.
