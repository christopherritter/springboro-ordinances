----------------

The continual compliance with the terms, contents and conditions of any
site plan approved by the Planning Commission is a requirement for
issuance of a zoning certificate, and a violation of any of those terms,
contents and conditions is grounds for revoking such certificate at any
time. All subsequent owners of the land and/or use covered by such site
plan shall maintain compliance with the approved site plan. Failure to
maintain compliance may result in termination of the use by revocation
of the zoning certificate.
