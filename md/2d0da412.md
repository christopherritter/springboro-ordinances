Pursuant to its role as administrative Appeal Board, the Board is
empowered to hold hearings, subpoena witnesses, take the testimony of
any person under oath and in connection therewith, to require the
production of any evidence relating to any matter being heard. In case
of the refusal of any person to comply with any subpoena issued
hereunder or to testify in any matter regarding which he or she may be
lawfully questioned, the Board may order such person to comply with such
subpoena and testify; and failure to obey the Board's order may be
punished by the Board as contempt.
