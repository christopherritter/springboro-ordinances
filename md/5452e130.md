1272.25 PHASING.
================

​(a) The establishment of common open spaces and the construction of
public or common residential facilities shown on the recorded final
development plan, together with the construction of other nonresidential
structures, shall proceed substantially in accordance with the phasing
program submitted pursuant to Section [1272.16](53cef663.html)(d)(4).

​(b) After general construction commences, the developer shall submit
progress reports every six (6) months to the Planning Commission which
shall review all building permits issued and compare them to the overall
development phasing program. If it is determined that the rate or
sequence of construction of the PUD substantially differs from the
phasing program, the Commission shall so notify the developer in
writing. Thereafter, the Commission may issue such orders to the
developer as it sees fit, and, upon continued violation of this section,
may suspend the developer from further construction of dwelling units or
nonresidential structures until compliance is achieved. (Ord. 02-4.
