​(a) Whenever any street has been divided into two roadways by an
intervening space, or by a physical barrier, or clearly indicated
dividing section so constructed as to impede vehicular traffic, every
vehicle shall be driven only upon the right-hand roadway, and no vehicle
shall be driven over, across or within any such dividing space, barrier
or median section, except through an opening, crossover or intersection
established by public authority. This section does not prohibit the
occupancy of such dividing space, barrier or median section for the
purpose of an emergency stop or in compliance with an order of a police
officer.

​(b) Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, whoever violates
this section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor. If, within one year of
the offense, the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded
guilty to one predicate motor vehicle or traffic offense, whoever
violates this section is guilty of a misdemeanor of the fourth degree.
If, within one year of the offense, the offender previously has been
convicted of two or more predicate motor vehicle or traffic offenses,
whoever violates this section is guilty of a misdemeanor of the third
degree.
