Section 8.11 Emergency Appropriations.
======================================

To meet a public emergency affecting life, health, safety, property or
the public welfare, the Council may make emergency appropriations. Such
appropriations may be made an emergency ordinance in accordance with the
provisions of Section [5.05](139512b4.html). To the extent that there
are no available unappropriated revenues to meet such appropriations,
the Council may by such emergency authorize the issuance of emergency
notes which may be renewed from time to time, but the emergency notes
and renewals of any fiscal year shall be paid not later than the last
day of the fiscal year next succeeding that in which the emergency
appropriation was made.
