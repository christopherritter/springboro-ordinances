Whenever, in the opinion of the Manager or his or her designee, there is an actual or threatened local emergency, such as a riot, fire, flood, excessive snowfall or other act of God, common disaster or act of the enemy, the Manager or his or her designee may require the removal of motor vehicles parked upon the streets in the Municipality designated by him or her. The Manager or his or her designee shall inform the public of such conditions through methods of communication deemed to be reasonable by the Manager or his or her designee. If the owner or operator of the vehicle does not remove such vehicle within a reasonable time, the vehicle may be removed by the Police Department at the owner's expense.
