"Explosives" means any chemical compound or mechanical mixture that is
intended for the purpose of producing an explosion that contains any
oxidizing and combustible units or other ingredients in such
proportions, quantities or packing that an ignition by fire, by
friction, by concussion, by percussion or by a detonator of any part of
the compound or mixture may cause such a sudden generation of highly
heated gases that the resultant gaseous pressures are capable of
producing destructive effects on contiguous objects, or of destroying
life or limb.

Manufactured articles shall not be held to be explosives when the
individual units contain explosives in such limited quantities, of such
nature or in such packing, that it is impossible to procure a
simultaneous or a destructive explosion of such units, to the injury of
life, limb or property by fire, by friction, by concussion, by
percussion or by a detonator, such as fixed ammunition for small arms,
firecrackers or safety fuse matches.
