406.04 POSTING OF SIGNS AND SIGNALS REQUIRED.
=============================================

No provision of this chapter shall be effective until signs, signals,
markings or other devices giving notice of such local traffic
regulations are posted upon or at the entrance to the street or part
thereof affected, as may be most appropriate, so that in a proper
position they are sufficiently legible to be seen by an ordinarily
observant person.
