dwelling units within the PUD and on parcels contiguous to the PUD.
Fences, insulation, walls, barriers and landscaping shall be used, as
appropriate, for the protection and aesthetic enhancement of property
and the privacy of its occupants, the screening of objectionable views
or uses and the reduction of noise.

â€‹(b) High-rise buildings shall be located within a PUD in such a way as
to dissipate any adverse impact on adjoining low-rise buildings and
shall not invade the privacy of the occupants of such low-rise
buildings. In PUDs which are not primarily residential in character,
these requirements may be relaxed as the Planning Commission finds
appropriate.
