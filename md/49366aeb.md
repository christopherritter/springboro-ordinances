Regulation of the subdivision of land and the attachment of reasonable
conditions to land subdivision is an exercise of valid police power
delegated by the State of Ohio to the City of Springboro. The developer
has the duty of compliance with reasonable conditions laid down by the
Planning Commission and City Council for design, dedication, improvement
and restrictive use of the land to conform to the physical and economic
development of the municipality and to the health, safety and general
welfare of the future lot owners in the subdivision and of the community
at large.
