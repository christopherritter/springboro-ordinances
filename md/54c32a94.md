1278.06 NONCONFORMING USES OF LAND.
===================================

Where, at the time of the adoption of this Zoning Code (Ordinance 546B,
passed February 25, 1976), a lawful use of land exists which is not
permitted by this Zoning Code, and where such use involves no individual
structure with a replacement cost exceeding one thousand dollars
($1,000), the use may be continued so long as it remains otherwise
lawful provided that:

​(a) No such nonconforming use shall be enlarged or increased or
extended to occupy a greater area of land than was occupied on the
effective date of adoption or amendment of this Zoning Code (Ordinance
546B, passed February 25, 1976).

​(b) No such nonconforming use shall be moved in whole or in part to any
portion of the lot or parcel other than that occupied by such use on the
effective date of adoption or amendment of this Zoning Code (Ordinance
546B, passed February 25, 1976).

​(c) If any such nonconforming use of land ceases for any reason for
more than thirty days, any subsequent use of such land shall conform to
the regulations of this Zoning Code for the district in which such land
is located.

​(d) No additional structure not conforming to this Zoning Code shall be
erected in connection with such nonconforming use of land.
