​(a) Within a time designated by the City Engineer and not less than
thirty (30) days following written notice from the City, the person that
owns the facility or related elements shall, at its own expense,
temporarily or permanently remove, relocate, change or alter the
position of any facilities within the public ways whenever the City
shall have determined that such removal, relocation, change or
alteration is reasonably necessary for any of the following:

​(1) The construction, repair, maintenance or installation of any City
or other public improvement in or upon the public ways.

​(2) The operations of the City or other governmental entity in or upon
the public ways. If the permit holder or owner fails to remove,
relocate, change or alter the facility within the time designated, the
City may, at its option, either have such relocation, removal, change or
alterations performed and bill the owner for such costs, or bill the
owner for increased costs incurred as a result of such failure.

​(b) No Utility Service Provider shall be required to bear the expense
of removal, relocation, change or alteration of position of any
Facilities if such requirement would be prohibited by law.
