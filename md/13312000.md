The powers of the City under this Charter shall be construed liberally
in favor of the Charter and the City, and the enumeration of particular
and specific powers in the Charter shall not be construed as limiting in
any way the general power to which this government is entitled under the
Constitution and laws of the State of Ohio. As used in this Charter,
unless the context otherwise requires, the singular includes the plural
and the plural includes the singular; words of one gender include the
other gender; and words in the present tense include the future.
