{{ page.title }}
================

​(a) Any license may be revoked by the Manager or other chief
administrative officer at any time for conditions or considerations
which, had they existed at the time of issuance, would have been valid
grounds for its denial; for any misrepresentation of a material fact in
the application discovered after issuance of the license; for a
violation of any of the provisions of this chapter or other law or
ordinance relating to the operation of the business or enterprise for
which the license has been issued; or upon conviction of a licensee for
a violation of any Federal, State or Municipal law or ordinance
involving moral turpitude. Such revocation shall become effective upon
notice served upon such licensee or posted upon the premises affected.

​(b) As a preliminary to revocation, the Manager or other chief
administrative officer may issue an order suspending a license, which
shall become effective immediately upon service of written notice to
such licensee. Such notice shall specify the reasons for suspension and
may provide conditions under which reinstatement of the license may be
obtained. Upon compliance with such conditions within the time
specified, such license may be restored.
