----------------

The Council may establish other departments in addition to those created
by this Charter as the needs of the City may require, and except for
those established in Section[7.01](13da2e6f.html), may abolish or
combine them in any manner as it deems necessary. They may prescribe the
functions and names, or change the names, of all departments except that
no function assigned by this Charter to a particular department may be
discontinued or, unless this Charter specifically so provides, assigned
to any other. (Amended 11-4-08.)
