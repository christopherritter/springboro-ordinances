{{ page.title }}
================

​(a) No pedestrian or driver of a vehicle shall disobey the instructions
of any traffic control device placed in accordance with the provisions
of this Traffic Code, unless at the time otherwise directed by a police
officer.

No provisions of this Traffic Code for which signs are required shall be
enforced against an alleged violator if at the time and place of the
alleged violation an official sign is not in proper position and
sufficiently legible to be seen by an ordinarily observant person.
Whenever a particular section of this Traffic Code does not state that
signs are required, that section shall be effective even though no signs
are erected or in place.

​(b) Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, whoever violates
this section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor. If, within one year of
the offense, the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded
guilty to one predicate motor vehicle or traffic offense, whoever
violates this section is guilty of a misdemeanor of the fourth degree.
If, within one year of the offense, the offender previously has been
convicted of two or more predicate motor vehicle or traffic offenses,
whoever violates this section is guilty of a misdemeanor of the third
degree.
