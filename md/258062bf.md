440.03 WHEEL PROTECTORS.
========================

​(a) No person shall drive or operate, or cause to be driven or
operated, any commercial car, trailer or semitrailer, used for the
transportation of goods or property, the gross weight of which, with
load, exceeds three tons, upon the streets, bridges and culverts within
this Municipality unless such vehicle is equipped with suitable metal
protectors or substantial flexible flaps on the rearmost wheels of such
vehicle or combination of vehicles to prevent, as far as practicable,
the wheels from throwing dirt, water or other materials on the
windshields of following vehicles. Such protectors or flaps shall have a
ground clearance of not more than one-third of the distance from the
center of the rearmost axle to the center of the flaps under any
conditions of loading of the vehicle, and they shall be at least as wide
as the tires they are protecting. If the vehicle is so designed and
constructed that such requirements are accomplished by means of fenders,
body construction or other means of enclosure, then no such protectors
or flaps are required. Rear wheels not covered at the top by fenders,
bodies or other parts of the vehicle shall be covered at the top by
protective means extending at least to the center line of the rearmost
axle. (ORC 5577.11)

​(b) Whoever violates this section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor.
