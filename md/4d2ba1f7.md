All applications for building permits shall be accompanied by plans, in
triplicate, drawn to scale, showing the actual dimensions and shape of
the lot to be built upon; the exact sizes and locations on the lot of
buildings already existing, if any; and the locations and dimensions of
the proposed building or alteration. The application shall include such
other information as lawfully may be required by the Building and Zoning
Inspector, including existing or proposed building or alteration;
existing or proposed uses of the building and land; the number of
families, housekeeping units or conditions existing on the lot; and such
other matters as may be necessary to determine conformity with, and
provide for the enforcement of, this Zoning Code. One copy of the plans
shall be returned to the applicant by the Inspector, after he or she has
marked such copy either as approved or disapproved and attested to the
same by his or her signature on such copy. The original and one copy of
the plans, similarly marked, shall be retained by the Inspector.
