Whenever any tree, plant, shrub or other vegetation or debris is trimmed
or removed by the Municipality, the City Manager shall give ten days
notice by regular mail to the owner of such lot or parcel of land, at
his or her last known address, to pay the cost of such trimming or
removal. Such notice shall be accompanied by a statement of the amount
of costs incurred. If such costs are not paid within thirty days after
the mailing of the notice, then such amount shall be a lien against the
property and may be certified to the County Auditor for collection in
the same manner as other taxes and assessments are collected. (Ord.
98-43. Passed 10-1-98.)
