If a meter stops or fails to register or has become out of order between
meter reading dates, an estimate of water consumed for the period shall
be made by the Director of Service, such estimate to be based on the
corresponding period of the preceding year or on the average established
for such period. Water meters shall be purchased by the Director and
shall remain the property of the Municipality at all times. Meters over
four inches shall be handled as special cases by the Director. When any
meter seal has been found broken from any cause, water service will be
immediately turned off and will not be restored until a fee as set forth
in Appendix A of Chapter [1464](58d37b9c.html) for such test. Meters
shall be kept easily accessible to meter readers and other authorized
personnel of the Division and no person shall permit a meter to become
covered or obstructed by rubbish or other material. No person shall
install a water meter in a coal cellar. Multiple service shall not be
permitted unless specifically authorized by the Director. Water service
provided by the Division shall not be resold by any consumer.
