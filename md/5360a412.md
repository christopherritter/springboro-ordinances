1272.03 PERMITTED USES; CATEGORIES OF PUDS .
============================================

An application for PUD zoning shall specify the land use category being
requested. An application may specify areas proposed to be developed
under different PUD categories or under combinations of PUD categories
and conventional zoning. Once PUD zoning is approved, land uses are
limited by two factors: 1) the PUD category for which application was
made, and 2) the authority and discretion of the Planning Commission, in
its approval of the General Plan and/or Final Development Plan, to
determine which of the allowable uses in the category may be permitted,
in what intensity and location, and under what conditions. PUDs may be
applied for under any of the following land use categories:

​(a) Planned Unit Development-Business (PUD-B) may allow any permitted
use in any Business Zoning District;

​(b) Planned Unit Development-Manufacturing (PUD-M) may allow any
permitted use in any Manufacturing Zoning District;

​(c) Planned Unit Development-Office (PUD-O) may allow any permitted use
in any Office Zoning District;

​(d) Planned Unit Development-Residential (PUD-R) may allow any
permitted use in any Residential Zoning District; and

​(e) Planned Unit Development-Mixed Use (POD-MU) may allow any
combination of any permitted use in any Business, Manufacturing, Office,
or Residential Zoning District as defined in Section
