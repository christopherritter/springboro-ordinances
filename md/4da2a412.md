title: 1262.29 INTERJURISDICTIONAL COOPERATION ON ZONING
AND LAND USE PLANNING ISSUES.

{{ page.title }}
----------------

There is hereby adopted in and for the Municipality a sensible "good
neighbor" policy, whereby notification of proceedings concerning
Municipal land use planning and rezoning shall be given to all property
owners who own properties located within the immediate neighborhood,
being located within 300 feet of the subject property, regardless of
what jurisdiction these neighboring properties are located within, and
also to any local governmental jurisdiction whose boundaries are located
within 500 feet of the subject property, which notifications shall be
mailed to the respective owners and jurisdictions which so qualify, so
that their comments and concerns can be considered in land use and
zoning decisions which concern property located within such close
proximity to such other jurisdictions. It is hoped that this policy of
cooperation will also be adopted by all of the Municipality's
neighboring jurisdictions so as to help create a more cooperative
environment within which better, more coordinated land use decisions can
be made.

(Res. 373. Passed 3-18-82.)
