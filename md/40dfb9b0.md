​(a) The opening and restoration of a pavement or other surface shall be
performed under the direction and to the satisfaction of the Director of
Service and in accordance with rules, regulations and specifications
approved by Council.

​(b) Upon the failure or refusal of the permittee to satisfactorily fill
the excavation, restore the surface and remove all excess materials
within the time specified in the permit or, where not specified therein,
within a reasonable time after commencement of the work, the
Municipality may proceed without notice to make such fill and
restoration and the deposit referred to in Section
[1022.02](40dc814b.html) shall be deemed forfeited. Thereupon, such
deposit shall be paid into the Street Repair Fund of the Municipality,
except such part demanded and paid to the permittee as the difference
between the deposit and the charges of the Municipality for restoration
services performed by it. If the amount of such services performed by
the Municipality exceeds the amount of such deposit, the Director of
Finance or other proper administrative officer shall proceed to collect
the remainder due from such permittee.
