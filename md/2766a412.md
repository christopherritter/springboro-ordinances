In any hearing on a charge of illegally parking a motor vehicle,
testimony that a vehicle bearing a certain license plate was found
unlawfully parked as prohibited by the provisions of this Traffic Code,
and further testimony that the record of the Ohio Registrar of Motor
Vehicles shows that the license plate was issued to the defendant, shall
be prima-facie evidence that the vehicle which was unlawfully parked,
was so parked by the defendant. A certified registration copy, showing
such fact, from the Registrar shall be proof of such ownership.
