----------------

​(a) Unless terminated by the City at an earlier date, a Certificate of
Registration shall expire three (3) years from the date of issuance by
the City.

​(b) In the event a provider continues to operate all or any part of the
facilities after the term of a Certificate of Registration, such
provider shall continue to comply with all applicable provisions of this
chapter and other laws throughout the period of such continued
operation, provided that any such continued operation shall in no way be
construed as a renewal or other extension of the Certificate of
Registration, nor as a limitation on the remedies, if any, available to
the City as a result of such continued operation after the term,
including, but not limited to, damages and restitution. Any conflict
between the issuance of a Certificate of Registration and any other
present or future lawful exercise of the City's regulatory or police
powers shall be resolved in favor of the latter. (Ord. 08-22. Passed
7-3-08.)
