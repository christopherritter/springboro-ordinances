1278.07 NONCONFORMING STRUCTURES.
=================================

Where a lawful structure exists on the effective date of adoption or
amendment of this Zoning Code (Ordinance 546B, passed February 25, 1976)
that cannot be built under the provisions of this Zoning Code by reason
of restrictions on area, lot coverage, height, yards, its location on
the lot or other requirements concerning the structure, such structure
may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the
following provisions:

​(a) No such nonconforming structure shall be enlarged or altered in a
way which increases its nonconformity, but any structure or portion
thereof may be altered to decrease its nonconformity.

​(b) Should such nonconforming structure or a nonconforming portion of
such structure be destroyed by any means to an extent of more than fifty
percent of its replacement cost at the time of destruction, it shall not
be reconstructed except in conformity with this Zoning Code.

​(c) Should such structure be moved for any reason for any distance, it
shall thereafter conform to the regulations for the district in which it
is located after it is moved.

(Ord. 99-20. Passed 5-6-99.)
