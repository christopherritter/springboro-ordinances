----------------

No use which is permitted as a conditional use in a district under the
provisions of this Zoning Code, other than a change, through action of
the Board of Zoning Appeals, from a nonconforming use to another use not
generally permitted in the district, shall be considered a nonconforming
use unless a subsequent change in zoning does not provide for the use as
a permitted or conditional use. (Ord. 99-20. Passed 5-6-99.)
