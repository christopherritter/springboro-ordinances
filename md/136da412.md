of its Council Members-elect and its own members, and the grounds for
forfeiture of their office, as listed in Section [4.05,](1353af4e.html)
and for that purpose Council, by ordinance, shall prescribe the process
of citing witnesses, administering oaths and producing evidence, and its
enforcement. If by an affirmative vote of five (5) members of Council, a
witness is declared in violation of the ordinance enforcing this

action before the proper court.

office, shall be entitled to a public hearing on demand, and notice of
such hearing shall be published in one or more newspapers of general
circulation in the City at least fifteen (15) days in advance of the
hearing. (Amended 11-4-08.)
