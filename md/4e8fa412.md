================

The purpose of the M-2 District is to provide land for major
manufacturing, processing, storage, warehousing, research and testing
establishments which require large sites, extensive community services
and facilities and ready access to regional transportation, which have
large open storage and service areas, which generate heavy traffic and
which create no nuisance discernible beyond the District. Extractive
manufacturing uses are permitted as conditional uses if the operations
do not create a hazard or nuisance which adversely affects the health,
safety and general well being of the community and other manufacturing
establishments in the District. Residential development is prohibited.
Light manufacturing or industrial uses are permitted as conditional
uses. Central water and sewer facilities are required.
