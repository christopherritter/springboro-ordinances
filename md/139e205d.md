----------------

Except as otherwise provided by this Charter, legislative ordinances may
be proposed, and legislative ordinances passed by the City Council may
be challenged, by initiative and referendum following procedures set
forth in the Ohio Revised Code. However, referendum shall not be
applicable to emergency ordinances, resolutions, motions, ordinances
implementing administrative actions, or ordinances making adjudicatory
decisions. If the Council is required to pass more than one ordinance to
complete and pay for any public improvement, initiative and referendum
shall apply only to the first ordinance passed and not to any subsequent
ordinance. Initiative and referendum petitions shall not be deemed filed
with the City until a written receipt therefor, indicating the time and
date of filing, has been issued by the Clerk of Council.

(Amended 11-4-08.)
