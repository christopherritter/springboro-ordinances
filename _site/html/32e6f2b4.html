<H1>642.12  CRIMINAL TRESPASS.</H1>

<P>(a) No person, without privilege to do so, shall do any of the following:

<P> (1) Knowingly enter or remain on the land or premises of another;

<P> (2) Knowingly enter or remain on the land or premises of another, the use of which is lawfully restricted to certain persons, purposes, modes or hours, when the offender knows the offender is in violation of any such restriction or is reckless in that regard;

<P> (3) Recklessly enter or remain on the land or premises of another, as to which notice against unauthorized access or presence is given by actual communication to the offender, or in a manner prescribed by law, or by posting in a manner reasonably calculated to come to the attention of potential intruders, or by fencing or other enclosure manifestly designed to restrict access;

<P> (4) Being on the land or premises of another, negligently fail or refuse to leave upon being notified by signage posted in a conspicuous place or otherwise being notified to do so by the owner or occupant, or the agent or servant of either.

<P>(b) It is no defense to a charge under this section that the land or premises involved was owned, controlled or in custody of a public agency.

<P>(c) It is no defense to a charge under this section that the offender was authorized to enter or remain on the land or premises involved when such authorization was secured by deception.

<P>(d) (1) Whoever violates this section is guilty of criminal trespass, a misdemeanor of the fourth degree.

<P> (2) Notwithstanding Section <A HREF="38e2f631.html">698.02</A>, if the person, in committing the violation of this section, used a snowmobile, off-highway motorcycle, or all-purpose vehicle, the court shall impose a fine of two times the usual amount imposed for the violation.

<P> (3) If an offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of this section or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, or state law, and the offender, in committing each violation, used a snowmobile, off-highway motorcycle, or all-purpose vehicle, the court, in addition to or independent of all other penalties imposed for the violation, may impound the certificate of registration of that snowmobile or off-highway motorcycle or the certificate of registration and license plate of that all-purpose vehicle for not less than sixty days. In such a case, Ohio R.C. 4519.47 applies.

<P>(e) As used in this section:

<P> (1) “All-purpose vehicle,” “off-highway motorcycle” and “snowmobile” have the same meaning as in Section <A HREF="2852e0c8.html">476.01</A> of the Traffic Code.

<P> (2) “Land or premises” includes any land, building, structure, or place belonging to, controlled by, or in custody of another, and any separate enclosure or room, or portion thereof.
