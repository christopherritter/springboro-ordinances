<H1>1272.12 EROSION AND SEDIMENTATION CONTROL.</H1>

<P>Effective erosion and sedimentation controls shall be planned and applied according to the following principles: 

<P>(a)  The smallest practical area of land should be exposed at any one time during development.

<P>(b) When land is exposed during development, the exposure should be kept to the shortest practical period of time.

<P>(c) Temporary vegetation and/or mulching shall be used to protect critical areas exposed during development.

<P>(d) Sediment basins (debris basins or silt traps) shall be installed and maintained to remove sediment from run-off waters from land undergoing development.

<P>(e) Provisions shall be made to accommodate the increased run-off caused by changed soil and surface conditions during and after development.

<P>(f) Permanent final vegetation and structures shall be installed as soon as practical in the development. 

<P>(g) The development shall be fitted to the topography and soils so as to create the least erosion potential.

<P>(h) Wherever feasible, natural vegetation should be retained and protected. Development of the PUD must conform to the municipal tree ordinance.

<P> (Ord. 02-4. Passed 1-17-02.)
