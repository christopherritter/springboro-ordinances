<H1>432.33  SLOW-MOVING VEHICLES OR EQUIPMENT AT GRADE CROSSINGS.</H1>

<P>(a) No person shall operate or move any crawler-type tractor, steam shovel, derrick, roller or any equipment or structure having a normal operating speed of six or less miles per hour or a vertical body or load clearance of less than nine inches above the level surface of a roadway upon or across any tracks at a railroad grade crossing without first complying with paragraphs (1) and (2) hereof.

<P> (1) Before making any such crossing, the person operating or moving such vehicle or equipment shall first stop the same, and while stopped he shall listen and look in both directions along such track for any approaching train and for signals indicating the approach of a train, and shall proceed only upon exercising due care.

<P> (2) No such crossing shall be made when warning is given by automatic signal or crossing gates or a flagman or otherwise of the immediate approach of a railroad train or car.

<P>(b) If the normal sustained speed of such vehicle, equipment or structure is not more than three miles per hour, the person owning, operating or moving the same shall also give notice of such intended crossing to a station agent or superintendent of the railroad, a reasonable time shall be given to such railroad to provide proper protection for such crossing. Where such vehicles or equipment is being used in constructing or repairing a section of street or highway lying on both sides of a railroad grade crossing, and in such construction or repair it is necessary to repeatedly move such vehicles or equipment over such crossing, one daily notice specifying when such work will start and stating the hours during which it will be prosecuted is sufficient.

<P>(c) Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, whoever violates this section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor. If, within one year of the offense, the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to one predicate motor vehicle or traffic offense, whoever violates this section is guilty of a misdemeanor of the fourth degree. If, within one year of the offense, the offender previously has been convicted of two or more predicate motor vehicle or traffic offenses, whoever violates this section is guilty of a misdemeanor of the third degree.
