<P>By letter filed with the Clerk of Council, the Manager shall designate a qualified City administrative officer to exercise the powers and perform the duties of Manager during temporary absence or disability. If such designation has not been made, and the Manager is, in the opinion of the majority vote of Council, unable to perform the Manager's duties or to make such designation, the Council shall, by resolution, appoint any qualified person, to perform the duties of the Manager, until the Manager shall return or the Manager's disability ceases. During such absence or disability, the Council may revoke such designation at any time and appoint another officer of the City to serve until the Manager shall return or the Manager's disability shall cease. (Amended 11-4-08.)
