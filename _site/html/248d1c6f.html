<P>(a) Every motor vehicle, trailer, semitrailer, and pole trailer when operated upon a street or highway shall be equipped with two or more stop lights, except that passenger cars manufactured or assembled prior to January 1, 1967, motorcycles, and motor-driven cycles shall be equipped with at least one stop light. Stop lights shall be mounted on the rear of the vehicle, actuated upon application of the service brake, and may be incorporated with other rear lights. Such stop lights when actuated shall emit a red light visible from a distance of five hundred feet to the rear, provided that in the case of a train of vehicles only the stop lights on the rear-most vehicle need be visible from the distance specified.

<P>Such stop lights when actuated shall give a steady warning light to the rear of a vehicle or train of vehicles to indicate the intention of the operator to diminish the speed of or stop a vehicle or train of vehicles.

<P>When stop lights are used as required by this section, they shall be constructed or installed so as to provide adequate and reliable illumination and shall conform to the appropriate rules and regulations established under Ohio R.C. 4513.19.

<P>Historical motor vehicles as defined in Ohio R.C. 4503.181, not originally manufactured with stop lights, are not subject to this section. 

<P>(b) Whoever violates this section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor.
