<H1>Section 5.05 Emergency Ordinances.</H1>

<P>To meet a public emergency affecting health, safety, morals, or the public welfare, or a special emergency in the operation of a City department the Council may adopt one or more emergency ordinances, but such ordinances may not: levy taxes, except when incidental to incurring debt; grant, renew, or extend a franchise, except one affecting health; regulate the rate charged by any public utility for its services; or grant any special privileges. An emergency ordinance shall be introduced in the form and manner prescribed for ordinances generally, except that it shall be plainly designated as an emergency ordinance and shall contain, after the enacting clause, a declaration stating that an emergency exists and describing it in clear and specific terms. A proposed emergency ordinance may be adopted with or without amendment or rejected at the meeting at which it is introduced, but the affirmative vote of at least five (5) members of Council shall be required for adoption. After its adoption the ordinance shall be published as prescribed for other adopted ordinances. It shall become effective upon adoption or at such later time as it may specify. 

<P>An emergency ordinance may also be repealed by adoption of a repealing ordinance in the same manner specified in this section for adoption of emergency ordinances. No emergency ordinance shall be subject to the initiative and referendum. (Amended 11-4-08.)
