<P>(a)  The opening and restoration of a pavement or other surface shall be performed under the direction and to the satisfaction of the Director of Service and in accordance with rules, regulations and specifications approved by Council. 

<P>(b)  Upon the failure or refusal of the permittee to satisfactorily fill the excavation, restore the surface and remove all excess materials within the time specified in the permit or, where not specified therein, within a reasonable time after commencement of the work, the Municipality may proceed without notice to make such fill and restoration and the deposit referred to in Section <A HREF="40dc814b.html">1022.02</A> shall be deemed forfeited. Thereupon, such deposit shall be paid into the Street Repair Fund of the Municipality, except such part demanded and paid to the permittee as the difference between the deposit and the charges of the Municipality for restoration services performed by it. If the amount of such services performed by the Municipality exceeds the amount of such deposit, the Director of Finance or other proper administrative officer shall proceed to collect the remainder due from such permittee.
