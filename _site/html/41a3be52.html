<H1>1028.09  EXPIRATION OF CERTIFICATE OF REGISTRATION.</H1>

<P>(a) Unless terminated by the City at an earlier date, a Certificate of Registration shall expire three (3) years from the date of issuance by the City. 

<P>(b) In the event a provider continues to operate all or any part of the facilities after the term of a Certificate of Registration, such provider shall continue to comply with all applicable provisions of this chapter and other laws throughout the period of such continued operation, provided that any such continued operation shall in no way be construed as a renewal or other extension of the Certificate of Registration, nor as a limitation on the remedies, if any, available to the City as a result of such continued operation after the term, including, but not limited to, damages and restitution. Any conflict between the issuance of a Certificate of Registration and any other present or future lawful exercise of the City's regulatory or police powers shall be resolved in favor of the latter. (Ord. 08-22. Passed 7-3-08.)
