<p>​(a) Common and Technical Usage. Words and phrases shall be read in context and construed according to the rules of grammar and common usage. Words and phrases that have acquired a technical or particular meaning, whether by legislative definition or otherwise, shall be construed accordingly.</p>

<p>(ORC 1.42)</p>

<p>​(b) Singular and Plural; Gender; Tense. As used in the Codified Ordinances, unless the context otherwise requires:</p>

<p>​(1) The singular includes the plural, and the plural includes the singular.</p>

<p>​(2) Words of one gender include the other genders.</p>

<p>​(3) Words in the present tense include the future.</p>

<p>(ORC 1.43)</p>

<p>​(c) Calendar; Computation of Time.</p>

<p>​(1) Definitions.</p>

<p>A. &#8220;Week&#8221; means seven consecutive days.</p>

<p>B. &#8220;Year&#8221; means twelve consecutive months.</p>

<p>(ORC 1.44)</p>

<p>​(2) If a number of months is to be computed by counting the months from a particular day, the period ends on the same numerical day in the concluding month as the day of the month from which the computation is begun, unless there are not that many days in the concluding month, in which case the period ends on the last day of that month.</p>

<p>(ORC 1.45)</p>

<p>​(3) The time within which an act is required by law to be done shall be computed by excluding the first and including the last day, except that when the last day falls on Sunday or a legal holiday, then the act may be done on the next succeeding day which is not a Sunday or a legal holiday.</p>

<p>When a public office, in which an act required by law is to be performed, is closed to the public for the entire day which constitutes the last day for doing such act or before its usual closing time on such day, then such act may be performed on the next succeeding day which is not a Sunday or a legal holiday. If any legal holiday falls on Sunday, the next succeeding day is a legal holiday.</p>

<p>(ORC 1.14)</p>

<p>​(4) When legislation is to take effect or become operative from and after a day named, no part of that day shall be included.</p>

<p>(ORC 1.15)</p>

<p>​(5) In all cases where the law shall require any act to be done in a reasonable time or reasonable notice to be given, such reasonable time or notice shall mean such time only as may be necessary for the prompt performance of such duty or compliance with such notice.</p>

<p>​(d) Authority. When the law requires an act to be done which may by law as well be done by an agent as by the principal, such requirement shall be construed to include all such acts when done by an authorized agent.</p>

<p>​(e) Joint Authority. All words purporting to give joint authority to three or more municipal officers or other persons shall be construed as giving such authority to a majority of such officers or other persons, unless it shall be otherwise expressly declared in the law giving the authority or inconsistent with State statute or Charter provisions.</p>

<p>​(f) Exceptions. The rules of construction shall not apply to any law which shall contain any express provision excluding such construction, or when the subject matter or context of such law may be repugnant thereto.</p>
