<p>(a) If an owner of private property posts on the property, in a conspicuous manner, a prohibition against parking on the property or conditions and regulations under which parking is permitted, no person shall do either of the following:</p>

<p>(1) Park a vehicle on the property without the owner&#8217;s consent; or</p>

<p>A. A notice that the property is a private tow-away zone and that vehicles not authorized to park on the property will be towed away;</p>

<p>B. The telephone number of the person from whom a towed-away vehicle can be recovered, and the address of the place to which the vehicle will be taken and the place from which it may be recovered;</p>

<p>(c) If a vehicle is parked on private property that is established as a private tow-away zone in accordance with subsection (b) hereof, without the consent of the owner of the property or in violation of any posted parking condition or regulation, the owner or his or her agent may remove, or cause the removal of, the vehicle. The owner and the operator of the vehicle shall be deemed to have consented to the removal and storage of the vehicle and to the payment of the towing and storage charges specified in paragraph (b)(1)C. hereof, and the owner, subject to subsection (f) hereof may recover a vehicle that has been so removed only in accordance with subsection (j) hereof.</p>

Upon payment of that fee, the motor vehicle or vehicle shall be released to the owner or operator, and upon its release, the owner or operator immediately shall move it so that:</p>

The record shall include an entry for each such motor vehicle or vehicle that identifies the motor vehicle&#8217;s or vehicle&#8217;s license number, make, model and color, the location from which it was removed, the date and time of its removal, the telephone number of the person from whom it may be recovered, and the address of the place to which it has been taken and from which it may be recovered. Any information in the record that pertains to a particular motor vehicle or vehicle shall be provided to any person who, either in person or pursuant to a telephone call, identifies himself or herself as the owner or operator of the motor vehicle or vehicle and requests information pertaining to its location.</p>

<p>(i) Any person who registers a complaint that is the basis of a Sheriff&#8217;s or Police Chief&#8217;s order for the removal and storage of a motor vehicle under Ohio R.C. 4513.60 shall provide the identity of the law enforcement agency with which the complaint was registered to any person who identifies himself or herself as the owner or operator of the motor vehicle and requests information pertaining to its location.</p>
