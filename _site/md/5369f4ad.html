<p>​(1) All densities are to be determined on the basis of gross dwelling units per acre, excluding such acreage as is used for nonresidential purposes, as determined by the Commission.</p>

<p>​(2) Densities may be increased by the Commission in the net project area where the factors listed herein make a substantial improvement in the PUD:</p>

<p>A. Landscaping; streetscape; open spaces and plazas; use of existing landscape; pedestrian way treatment; and residential areas;</p>

<p>B. Setting, visual focus points; use of existing physical features such as topography; view of sun and wind orientation; circulation pattern; physical environment; variation in building setbacks; and building groups (such as clustering);</p>

<p>C. Design features; street sections; architectural styles; harmonious use of materials; parking areas broken by landscape features; and varied use of building types; or</p>

<p>​(c) Minimum Requirements.</p>

<p>​(1) Dwelling unit size, yard setback, type of dwelling unit, frontage and use restrictions, as established by conventional zoning may be waived for PUDs, provided that the intent and objectives of Section <a href='5336b269.html'>1272.01</a> are complied within the total development plan, as determined by the Commission. Further provided no open structures shall encroach within ten (10) feet of the rear yard line.

<p>​(2) Every dwelling unit shall have continuous paved pedestrian access to adequate vehicle parking facilities conveniently located nearby.</p>

<p>​(d) Perimeter Requirements. If topographical or other barriers within the development do not provide reasonable privacy for existing uses adjacent to the development, the Commission shall impose either of the following requirements, or both:</p>

<p>​(1) Structures located on the perimeter of the development must be set back in accordance with the provisions of the conventional zoning district most similar in nature and function to the portion of the PUD in which the structure within the development is situated.</p>

<p>​(2) Structures located on the perimeter of the development must be well screened in a manner approved by the Commission.</p>

<p>(Ord. 02-4. Passed 1-17-02.)</p>

<p>​(e) Open Structures.

A PUD shall provide for the possible future construction of open structures on the property by individual lot owners by setting forth in the PUD the maximum distance such open structures may encroach into the rear yard setback provided same is within the intent and objectives of Section <a href='5336b269.html'>1272.01</a> and approved by the Planning Commission.
