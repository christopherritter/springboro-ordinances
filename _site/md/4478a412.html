<p>​(a) No person shall discharge or cause to be discharged any storm water, surface water, ground water, roof run-off, subsurface drainage, uncontaminated cooling water or unpolluted industrial process water to any sanitary sewer.</p>

<p>​(b) Storm water and all other unpolluted drainage shall be discharged to such sewers as are specifically designated as storm sewers, or to a natural outlet approved by the Inspector. Industrial cooling water or unpolluted process water may be discharged, on approval of the Inspector and upon the issuance of an N.P.D.E.S. permit, to a storm sewer or natural outlet.</p>

<p>​(c) No person shall discharge or cause to be discharged any of the following described waters or wastes into any public sewer:</p>

<p>​(1) Any gasoline, benzene, naphtha, fuel oil or other flammable or explosive material or volatile liquid;</p>

<p>​(2) Any water or waste containing toxic or poisonous solids, liquids or gases in sufficient quantity, either singly or by interaction with other wastes, to injure or interfere with any sewage treatment process, constitute a hazard to humans or animals or create a public nuisance or a hazard in receiving waters of the sewage treatment plan, including, but not limited to, cyanides in excess of two mg/l as a cyanide ion in the wastes as discharged to the public sewer;</p>

<p>​(3) Any water or waste having a pH lower than 6.0 or greater than 9.0 or having any other corrosive property capable of causing damage or hazard to structures, equipment and personnel of the sewage works; or</p>

<p>​(4) Solid or viscous substances in quantities or of such size capable of causing obstruction to the flow in sewers, or other interference with the proper operation of the sewage works, including, but not limited to, ashes, cinders, sand, mud, straw, shavings, metal, glass, rags, feathers, tar, plastics, wood, unground garbage, whole blood, paunch manure, hair and fleshings, entrails, paper dishes, cups, milk containers, etc., either whole or ground by garbage grinders, and any material which, by reason of mixture or interaction, tends to cause obstruction or otherwise interferes with the operation of the sewage works.</p>

<p>​(5) No person shall discharge or cause to be discharged any water or waste in violation of the NPDES permit discharge limits.</p>

<p>​(d) No person shall discharge or cause to be discharged the following described substances, materials, waters or wastes if it appears likely that the same can harm either the sewers or the sewage treatment process or equipment, have an adverse effect on the receiving stream or otherwise endanger life, limb or public property or constitute a nuisance. In forming an opinion as to the acceptability of such wastes, consideration will be given to such factors as the quantities of subject wastes in relation to flows and velocities in the sewers, the materials of construction of the sewers, the nature of the treatment process capacity of the sewage treatment plant, the degree of treatability of wastes in the sewage treatment plant and other pertinent factors. Prohibited substances include the following:</p>

<p>​(1) Any liquid or vapor having a temperature higher than 150 degrees Fahrenheit (sixty-five degrees Centigrade);</p>

<p>​(2) Any water or waste containing fats, wax, grease or oils, whether emulsified or not, in excess of 100 mg/l or containing substances which may solidify or become viscous at temperatures between thirty-two and 150 degrees Fahrenheit (zero and sixty-five degrees Centigrade);</p>

<p>​(3) Any garbage that has not been properly shredded. The installation and operation of any garbage grinder equipped with a motor of three-fourths horsepower (0.76 hp metric) or greater shall be subject to the review and approval of the Municipality.</p>

<p>​(4) Any water or waste containing acid iron pickling wastes or concentrated plating solutions, whether neutralized or not, without prior approval of the Municipality;</p>

<p>​(5) Any water or waste containing arsenic, cadmium, chromium, chromium hexavalent, chromium trivalent, copper, iron, lead, mercury, nickel, phenol, phathalate esters, silver, zinc or any other pollutant prohibited by Section 307(a) of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, as amended, or a similar objectionable or toxic substance, or wastes exerting an excessive chlorine requirement, to such a degree that any such material received in the composite sewage at the sewage treatment works exceeds the limits established by the Municipality for such materials;</p>

<p>​(6) Any water or waste containing phenols or other toxic or odor-producing substances, in such concentrations as exceed limits which may be established by the Municipality as necessary, after treatment of the composite sewage, to meet the requirements of the State, Federal or other public agencies of jurisdiction for such discharge to the receiving waters;</p>

<p>​(7) Any radioactive waste or isotope of such half-life or concentration as may exceed established limits in compliance with applicable State or Federal regulations;</p>

<p>​(8) Materials which exert or cause:</p>

<p>A. Unusual concentrations of inert suspended solids (such as, but not limited to, Fullers earth, lime slurries and lime residues) or of dissolved solids (such as, but not limited to, sodium chloride and sodium sulfate);</p>

<p>B. Excessive discoloration (such as, but not limited to, dye wastes and vegetable tanning solutions);</p>

<p>C. Unusual BOD, COD or chlorine requirements in such quantities as to constitute a significant load on the sewage treatment works; or</p>

<p>D. An unusual volume of flow or concentration of wastes constituting &#8220;slugs; &#8221; or</p>

<p>​(9) Any water or waste containing substances which are not amenable to treatment or reduction by the sewage treatment processes employed, or are amenable to treatment only to such degree that the sewage treatment plant effluent cannot meet the requirements of other agencies having jurisdiction over discharge to the receiving waters.</p>

<p>​(e) If any water or waste is discharged, or is proposed to be discharged, to the public sewers, which water or waste contains the substances or possesses the characteristics enumerated in subsection (d) hereof, and which may have a deleterious effect upon the sewage works, processes, equipment or receiving waters, or which otherwise creates a hazard to life or constitutes a public nuisance, the Municipality may:</p>

<p>​(1) Reject the wastes;</p>

<p>​(2) Require pretreatment to an acceptable condition for discharge to the public sewers;</p>

<p>​(3) Require control over the quantities and rates of discharge; and/or</p>

<p>​(4) Require payment to cover the added cost of handling and treating the wastes not covered by existing taxes or sewer charges under subsection (j) hereof.</p>

<p>If the Municipality permits the pretreatment or equalization of waste flows, then the design and installation of the plants and equipment shall be subject to the review and approval of the Municipality and to the requirements of all applicable codes, ordinances and laws.</p>

<p>​(f) Grease, oil and sand interceptors shall be provided when they are necessary for the proper handling of liquid wastes containing grease in excessive amounts or any flammable wastes, sand or other harmful ingredients. However, such interceptors shall not be required for private living quarters or dwelling units. All interceptors shall be of a type and capacity approved by the Municipality and shall be located as to be readily and easily accessible for cleaning and inspection.</p>

<p>​(g) Where preliminary treatment or flow-equalizing facilities are provided for any water or waste, they shall be maintained continuously in satisfactory and effective operation by the owner at his or her expense.</p>

<p>​(h) When required by the Municipality, the owner of any property serviced by a building sewer carrying industrial wastes shall install a suitable control manhole together with such necessary meters and other appurtenances in the building sewer as are needed to facilitate the observation, sampling and measurement of wastes. Such manhole, when required, shall be accessibly and safely located and shall be constructed in accordance with plans approved by the Municipality. The manhole shall be installed by the owner at his or her expense and shall be maintained by the owner so as to be safe and accessible at all times.</p>

<p>​(i) All measurements, tests and analyses of the characteristics of waters and wastes to which reference is made in this chapter shall be determined in accordance with the latest edition of &#8220;Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and Wastewater,&#8221; published by the American Public Health Association, or otherwise, by Environmental Protection Agency approved methods and shall be determined at the control manhole provided or upon suitable samples taken at such manhole. If no special manhole has been required, the control manhole shall be considered to be the nearest downstream manhole in the public sewer to the point at which the building sewer is connected. Sampling shall be carried out by customarily accepted methods to reflect the effect of constituents upon the sewage works and to determine the existence of hazards to life, limb and property. The particular analyses involved will determine whether a twenty-four hour composite of all outfalls of a premises is appropriate or whether a grab sample should be taken. Normally, but not always, BOD and suspended solids analyses are obtained from twenty-four hour composites of all outfalls where pH is determined from periodic grab samples.</p>

<p>​(j) Nothing contained in this section shall be construed as preventing any special agreement or arrangement between the Municipality and any industrial concern whereby an industrial waste of unusual strength or character may be accepted by the Municipality for treatment, subject to the payment of a surcharge based on the strength and character of the waste, provided such payment is in accordance with Federal and State guidelines for user charge systems and industrial cost recovery systems.</p>

<p>​(k) The Municipality shall have the right to reject any industrial waste which may not be compatible with the treatment process or the sewage works. The Municipality further has the right to require pretreatment of industrial wastes, if deemed necessary, and to impose a surcharge commensurate with any added difficulty or added direct cost associated with an industrial waste.</p>

<p>​(l) A system of industrial cost recovery, in accordance with Section <a href='44f76a4d.html'>1044.13</a>, shall be instituted by the Municipality prior to the acceptance of any industrial waste.</p>

<p>​(m) As a safeguard to public health, the following notification procedures shall apply in the event of an accidental spill. Any industrial user shall notify the City Manager immediately upon the occurrence of a &#8220;slug&#8221;, load or accidental discharge of a substance prohibited by this section or applicable State or Federal law. The initial notification shall include at a minimum the following information: location of the discharge, date and time of the discharge, material discharged, concentration, volume discharged and any corrective action already taken.</p>

<p>These reports shall be confirmed in writing within five days of the discharge and submitted on the City Accident Spill Form to the City Manager. Failure to report shall be grounds for revocation of an industrial waste permit and termination of sewer service.</p>

<p>Any industrial user who discharges a slug load of prohibited materials shall be liable for any expense, loss or damage to the municipal sewer system, in addition to the amount of any fines imposed on the Authority or account thereof under State or Federal law.</p>

<p>Signs shall be posted by the industrial user in conspicuous places on the industrial user&#8217;s premises, advising employees when to call in the event of a slug or accidental discharge to the municipal sewer system. Employers shall instruct all employees who may cause or discover such discharge with respect to emergency notification procedures and countermeasure actions.</p>

<p>​(n) Discharge reporting requirements are hereby established for extra strength industrial users in the Municipality. All extra strength industrial users are hereby required to submit an industrial permits report in compliance with applicable Federal and State discharge reporting requirements to the Municipality. (Ord. 93-71. Passed 11-4-93.)</p>
