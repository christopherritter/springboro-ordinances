<p>(a) Whenever special pedestrian control signals exhibiting the words &#8220;walk&#8221; or &#8220;don&#8217;t walk&#8221;, or the symbol of a walking person or an upraised palm are in place, such signals shall indicate the following instructions:</p>

<p>(1) A steady walking person signal indication, which symbolizes &#8220;walk&#8221;, means that a pedestrian facing the signal indication is permitted to start to cross the roadway in the direction of the signal indication, possibly in conflict with turning vehicles. The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the walking person signal indication is first shown.</p>

<p>(2) A flashing upraised hand signal indication, which symbolizes &#8220;don&#8217;t walk&#8221;, means that a pedestrian shall not start to cross the roadway in the direction of the signal indication, but that any pedestrian who has already started to cross on a steady walking person signal indication shall proceed to the far side of the traveled way of the street or highway, unless otherwise directed by a traffic control device to proceed only to the median of a divided highway or only to some other island or pedestrian refuge area.</p>

<p>(3) A steady upraised hand signal indication means that a pedestrian shall not enter the roadway in the direction of the signal indication.</p>

<p>(4) Nothing int his section shall be construed to invalidate the continued use of pedestrian control signals utilizing the word &#8220;wait&#8221; if those signals were installed prior to March 28, 1985.</p>

<p>(5) A flashing walking person signal indication has no meaning and shall not be used. (ORC 4511.14)</p>

<p>(b) Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, whoever violates this section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor. If, within one year of the offense, the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to one predicate motor vehicle or traffic offense, whoever violates this section is guilty of a misdemeanor of the fourth degree. If, within one year of the offense, the offender previously has been convicted of two or more predicate motor vehicle or traffic offenses, whoever violates this section is guilty of a misdemeanor of the third degree.</p>
