<p>(a) In case of accident or collision resulting in injury or damage to persons or property upon any public or private property other than public roads or highways, due to the driving or operation thereon of any motor vehicle, the person driving or operating the motor vehicle, having knowledge of the accident or collision, shall stop, and, upon request of the person injured or damaged, or any other person, shall give that person the driver&#8217;s or operator&#8217;s name and address, and, if the driver or operator is not the owner, the name and address of the owner of that motor vehicle, together with the registered number of that motor vehicle, and, if available, exhibit the driver&#8217;s or operator&#8217;s driver&#8217;s or commercial driver&#8217;s license.</p>

<p>If the owner or person in charge of the damaged property is not furnished such information, the driver of the motor vehicle involved in the accident or collision, within twenty- four hours after the accident or collision, shall forward to the police authority in the municipality in which the accident or collision occurred the same information required to be given to the owner or person in control of the damaged property and give the date, time, and location of the accident or collision.</p>

<p>Whoever violates subsection (a) of this section is guilty of failure to stop after a nonpublic road accident, a misdemeanor of the first degree. If the accident or collision results in serious physical harm or death to a person, failure to stop after a nonpublic road accident is a felony and shall be prosecuted under appropriate state law.</p>

<p>(b) Whoever violates subsection (a) of this section is guilty of failure to stop after a nonpublic road accident, a misdemeanor of the first degree.
