<hr />
<p>No person shall maintain, renew, change or extend a nonconforming structure or use without first obtaining a zoning certificate therefor from the Building and Zoning Inspector. The zoning certificate shall state specifically wherein the nonconforming use differs from the provisions of this Zoning Code, provided that upon enactment or amendment of this Zoning Code, the owners or occupants of nonconforming uses or structures shall have six months to apply for zoning certificates. Failure to make such application within six months shall be presumptive evidence that the property was in conforming use at the time of enactment or amendment of this Zoning Code.</p>
