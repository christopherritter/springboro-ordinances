Such regulations, limitations and prohibitions may be changed and modified by the City Manager from time to time during such state of water availability emergency as the City Manager may determine to be necessary and prudent. Such regulations, limitations and prohibitions may include but shall not be limited to a total and complete emergency water ban allowing use for health needs only.
