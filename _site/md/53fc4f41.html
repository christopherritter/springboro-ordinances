<hr />
<p>​(a) The Planning Commission shall review the application for amendment of the official zoning map with the proposed general plan and may recommend the zoning map amendment and general plan to City Council if it determines that the plan satisfies, at a minimum, all of the following criteria:</p>

<p>​(1) PUD zoning and the general plan are in conformance with the Comprehensive Land Use Master Plan for the City of Springboro, supporting plans, and related legislation as adopted by City Council;</p>

<p>​(2) An exemption to conventional zoning is justified because the Comprehensive Land Use Master Plan for the City of Springboro can be more faithfully and reliably implemented by the use of PUD zoning;</p>

<p>​(3) The general plan is compatible with the location, topographic and other characteristics of the site and will bear a beneficial relationship with surrounding land uses in terms of noise, smoke, dust, debris, or other nuisances;</p>

<p>​(4) The general plan is carefully designed to support surrounding streets, utilities and other public improvements;</p>

<p>​(5) The general plan represents an efficient and economic use of the land in view of the community&#8217;s need for a balance of land uses;</p>

<p>​(6) All public streets, utilities and services necessary to carry out the general plan are available to the site, or will be extended or improved by the developer and/or City in time to permit the development to be properly served;</p>

<p>​(7) Exception from conventional zoning is warranted by design goals or other criteria and/or the need to provide a variety of development opportunities within the community;</p>

<p>​(8) The design of the development protects natural assets such as streams, woodlots, steep terrain, and other critical environments in the City;</p>

<p>​(9) Taken as a whole the development of the proposed PUD will have a positive effect on the health, safety, and general welfare of the City of Springboro;</p>

<p>​(10) The general plan appears capable of being implemented by a final development plan which meets all requirements of this chapter; and</p>

<p>​(11) Implementation of the general plan will be initiated within one (1) year of approval.</p>

<p>​(b) The Planning Commission shall make a formal recommendation to the City Council regarding the application for amendment of the official zoning map in accordance with Chapter <a href='55e00b38.html'>1266</a> (Official Zoning Map) of the Zoning Code.</p>

<p>​(c) The general plan need not be recorded in the records of Montgomery or Warren County. (Ord. 02-4. Passed 1-17-02.)</p>
