  <h2 id='43410_approaching_a_stationary_public_safety_emergency_or_road_service_vehicle'>434&#46;10 APPROACHING A STATIONARY PUBLIC SAFETY, EMERGENCY OR ROAD SERVICE VEHICLE.</h2>

<p>(a) The driver of a motor vehicle, upon approaching a stationary public safety vehicle, an emergency vehicle, or a road service vehicle that is displaying the appropriate visual signals by means of flashing, oscillating or rotating lights, as prescribed in Section <a href='243669a2.html'>438.16</a>, shall do either of the following:</p>

<p>(1) If the driver of the motor vehicle is traveling on a street or highway that consists of at least two lanes that carry traffic in the same direction of travel as that of the driver&#8217;s motor vehicle, the driver shall proceed with due caution and, if possible with due regard to the road, weather, and traffic conditions, shall change lanes into a lane that is not adjacent to that of the stationary public safety vehicle, an emergency vehicle, or a road service vehicle.</p>

<p>(2) If the driver is not traveling on a street or highway of a type described in subsection (a)(1) of this section, or if the driver is traveling on a highway of that type but it is not possible to change lanes or if to do so would be unsafe, the driver shall proceed with due caution, reduce the speed of the motor vehicle, and maintain a safe speed for the road, weather and traffic conditions.</p>

<p>(b) This section does not relieve the driver of a public safety vehicle, an emergency vehicle, or a road service vehicle from the duty to drive with due regard for the safety of all persons and property upon the highway.</p>

<p>(c) No person shall fail to drive a motor vehicle in compliance with subsection (a)(1) or (2) of this section when so required by subsection (a) of this section.</p>

<p>(d) (1) Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, whoever violates this section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor. If, within one year of the offense, the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to one predicate motor vehicle or traffic offense, whoever violates this section is guilty of a misdemeanor of the fourth degree. If, within one year of the offense, the offender previously has been convicted of two or more predicate motor vehicle or traffic offenses, whoever violates this section is guilty of a misdemeanor of the third degree.</p>

<p>(2) Notwithstanding Section <a href='1ce9ca02.html'>404.99</a>(b), upon a finding that a person operated a motor vehicle in violation of subsection (c) of this section, the court, in addition to all other penalties provided by law, shall impose a fine of two times the usual amount imposed for the violation.
