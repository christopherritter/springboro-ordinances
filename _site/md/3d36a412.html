<p>​(b) The Director of Department of Police or his/her designee, shall revoke a permit upon determining that:</p>

<p>​(2) A permittee or an employee has knowingly allowed possession, use or sale of controlled substances in or on the premises; or</p>

<p>​(3) A permittee or an employee has knowingly allowed prostitution on the premises; or</p>

<p>​(6) On two or more occasions within a twelve month period, a person or persons committed an offense, occurring in or on the permitted premises, constituting a &#8220;specified criminal act&#8221; for which a conviction has been obtained, and the person or persons were employees of the sexually oriented business at the time the offenses were committed. The fact that a conviction is being appealed shall have no effect on the revocation of the permit; or</p>

<p>​(7) A permittee is convicted of tax violations for any taxes or fees related to a sexually oriented business, or</p>

<p>​(8) A permittee or an employee has knowingly allowed any act of sexual intercourse, sodomy, oral copulation, masturbation, or any other specified sexual activities to occur in or on the permitted premises.</p>
