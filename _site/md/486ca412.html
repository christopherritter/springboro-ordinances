<p>To consider the establishment of a Historic Preservation District or Landmark, the following procedure shall be followed:</p>

<p>(a) The initiation of a proposal for a Historic Preservation District may be made only by one or more citizens of Springboro, or a City board, commission, or committee. The initiation of a proposal for a Landmark may be made only by the property owner or by a majority of the membership of the City Council.</p>

<p>(b) The proposal shall be submitted to the ARB.</p>

<p>(c) All known legal or equitable owners of the designated property and abutting property owners shall be notified by mail of the proposal, and their written comments requested.</p>

<p>(d) After review, the ARB shall forward the proposal with its recommendation and the owners&#8217; written comments to the Planning Commission.</p>

<p>(e) The Planning Commission shall review the proposal, the recommendations of the ARB and the owners&#8217; written comments and shall forward them to the City Council with a recommendation.</p>

<p>(f) Upon receipt of the Planning Commission&#8217;s recommendation, the City Council shall cause an appropriate ordinance to be prepared, shall schedule a public hearing on the proposed legislation, setting forth a date, time and place, and shall cause written notice to be given to the owner or any person having a legal or equitable interest in the property being proposed for designation.</p>

<p>(g) The City Council shall give due consideration to the findings and recommendations of the ARB and Planning Commission, to the owners&#8217; written comments, and to the public hearing comments, in making its determination.</p>

<p>(h) After a decision by the City Council, the Clerk of Council shall notify all persons known to have a legal or equitable interest in said property. The Planning Commission and the ARB shall also be notified.</p>

<p>(i) Notwithstanding any provision of this chapter, the City Council may at any time, after conducting a public hearing with reasonable advance written notice being mailed to the affected property owners, rescind by ordinance the designation of any area, place, building, or structure as a Landmark, Historic Preservation District or contributing structure within a Historic Preservation District.</p>

<p>(j) The Clerk of Council shall notify any appropriate county and/or state offices after a designation is approved or rescinded.</p>

<p>(k) No legislation under this section shall be rendered invalid by any failure or alleged failure of the Clerk of Council to provide a prescribed notice, by mail or otherwise, to any person. (Ord. 05-5. Passed 3-3-05.)</p>
