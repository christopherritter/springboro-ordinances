<p>(b) No person, with purpose to defraud, shall issue or transfer or cause to be issued or transferred a check or other negotiable instrument, knowing that it will be dishonored or knowing that a person has ordered or will order stop payment on the check or other negotiable instrument.</p>

<p>(c) For purposes of this section, a person who issues or transfers a check or other negotiable instrument is presumed to know that it will be dishonored, if either of the following occurs:</p>

<p>(1) The drawer had no account with the drawee at the time of issue or the stated date, whichever is later.</p>

<p>(2) The check or other negotiable instrument was properly refused payment for insufficient funds upon presentment within thirty days after issue or the stated date, whichever is later, and the liability of the drawer, indorser or any party who may be liable thereon is not discharged by payment or satisfaction within ten days after receiving notice of dishonor.</p>

<p>(d) For purposes of this section, a person who issues or transfers a check, bill of exchange or other draft is presumed to have the purpose to defraud if the drawer fails to comply with Ohio R.C. 1349.16 by doing any of the following when opening a checking account intended for personal, family or household purposes at a financial institution:</p>

<p>(1) Falsely stating that the drawer has not been issued a valid driver&#8217;s or commercial driver&#8217;s license or identification card issued under Ohio R.C. 4507.50;</p>

<p>(2) Furnishing such license or card, or another identification document that contains false information;</p>

<p>(3) Making a false statement with respect to the drawer&#8217;s current address or any additional relevant information reasonably required by the financial institution.</p>

<p>(e) In determining the value of the payment for purposes of subsection (f) of this section, the court may aggregate all checks and other negotiable instruments that the offender issued or transferred or caused to be issued or transferred in violation of subsection (a) of this section within a period of one hundred eighty consecutive days.</p>

<p>(f) Whoever violates this section is guilty of passing bad checks. Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, passing bad checks is a misdemeanor of the first degree.
