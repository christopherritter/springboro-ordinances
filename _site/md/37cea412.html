<p>(2) If a person is convicted of, was convicted of, pleads guilty to, or has pleaded guilty to a violation of subsection (b) of this section as it existed prior to the effective date of this amendment and if the conduct that was the basis of the violation no longer would be a violation of subsection (b) of this section on or after the effective date of this amendment, the person may file an application under Ohio R.C. 2953.37 requesting the expungement of the record of conviction.</p>

<p>(g) If a law enforcement officer stops a motor vehicle for a traffic stop or any other purpose, if any person in the motor vehicle surrenders a firearm to the officer, either voluntarily or pursuant to a request or demand of the officer, and if the officer does not charge the person with a violation of this section or arrest the person for any offense, the person is not otherwise prohibited by law from possessing the firearm, and the firearm is not contraband, the officer shall return the firearm to the person at the termination of the stop.
