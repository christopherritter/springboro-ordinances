<p>​(a) Mayor. The Mayor shall be elected by separate ballot from the City-at-large for a four (4)-year term. The Mayor shall be a Council Member and have the right to vote on all issues before the Council, but shall have no veto power. In addition to the powers, rights and duties as a Council Member as herein provided, the Mayor, when present, shall preside at meetings of the Council, shall be recognized as head of the City government for all ceremonial and non-administrative purposes, by the Governor for purposes of military law, and by the Courts for civil process involving the City. The Mayor shall have judicial powers. The Mayor shall perform all other duties prescribed for the office by ordinance or by resolutions of the Council not inconsistent with the provisions of this Charter.</p>

<p>​(b) Deputy-Mayor. The Council shall, at the first regular meeting in January following its election, choose, by a majority vote of all members of the Council, one of its members a Deputy-Mayor who shall act as Mayor during the absence or disability of the Mayor. If a vacancy occurs, the Deputy-Mayor shall serve as Mayor until the next regular City election. At such election, a Mayor shall be elected to serve for the unexpired term, if any; if not, for a full term. Upon the election of a Mayor, other than the Deputy-Mayor then serving as Mayor, the Deputy-Mayor may retain a position as Council Member for the remainder of his unexpired term.</p>

<p>In the event of a vacancy in the office of Mayor whereby the Deputy-Mayor is required to serve as Mayor, the Council shall select a person to fill the vacancy in Council as provided in Section <a href='1353af4e.html'>4.05</a>(d). However, the person so chosen shall serve only until a Mayor is elected as provided herein. (Amended 11-4-08.)</p>
