<p>​(a) Notwithstanding anything stated in Sections <a href='42fa4b74.html'>1042.14</a>, if the circumstances described in subsection (b) hereof exist, then the tap-in fee for the Municipal water system shall be determined pursuant to subsection (c) hereof.</p>

<p>​(b) The water system fee computed pursuant to subsection (c) hereof shall apply to any property that meets the following conditions:</p>

<p>​(1) The property abuts, abounds or is served by an extension to the waterworks system that is constructed after the date of the adoption of this section (Ordinance 942, passed March 19, 1981) by the Municipality and financed with funds of the Municipality.</p>

<p>​(2) The cost of constructing such extension to the waterworks system is not paid for with any special assessment levied against the property.</p>

<p>​(3) The property has not previously been assessed for a water system extension.</p>

<p>​(c) The water system tap-in fee for any property described in subsection (b) hereof shall be the total of the following:</p>

<p>​(1) A basic fee as determined by the provisions of Section <a href='43222e13.html'>1042.10</a> relevant to the type of tap-in proposed; plus</p>

<p>​(2) A sum per front foot of the property abutting and abounding the water system extension, such sum to be determined by the Engineer and to be an estimated front foot cost (including all expenses relative to the water system extension listed in Ohio R.C. 727.08) to construct a six-inch water main extension, provided that each property shall be charged on the basis of a front footage of 100 feet or the actual footage abutting and abounding the water system extension, whichever is greater, and provided, further, that if the water system extension abuts or abounds the property on more than one side, then the property shall be charged on the basis of a front footage of 100 feet or the actual footage on the longest side of the property that abuts or abounds the water system improvement, whichever is greater; plus</p>

<p>​(3) If the property is subdivided after the construction of the water main extension, the Engineer shall add to the cost of the tap-in fee the actual construction cost (including all expenses relative to the project listed in Ohio R.C. 727.08) of any oversizing of the water system beyond that covered in paragraph (c)(2) hereof required for the overall efficient operation of the Municipal water system, as determined by the Engineer, plus interest on such costs at the rate of eight percent per year, computed from the date the Municipality borrows money from such costs or pays a contractor any portion of the cost of such oversizing (whichever date is earlier) to the date of payment of the tap-in fee.</p>
