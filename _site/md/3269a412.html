<p>(1) Unless subsection (c)(2) of this section applies, suspend for not more than six months the offender&#8217;s driver&#8217;s license, probationary driver&#8217;s license, commercial driver&#8217;s license, temporary instruction permit, or nonresident operating privilege;</p>

<p>(2) If the offender&#8217;s driver&#8217;s license, probationary driver&#8217;s license, commercial driver&#8217;s license, temporary instruction permit, or nonresident operating privilege has previously been suspended pursuant to subsection (c)(1) of this section, impose a class seven suspension of the offender&#8217;s license, permit, or privilege from the range specified in Ohio R.C. 4510.02(A)(7), provided that the suspension shall be for at least six months.</p>
