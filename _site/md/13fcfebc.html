<p>There shall be a Department of Law, the head of which shall be the Law Director. The Law Director shall be an attorney-at-law, qualified to practice law in the State of Ohio, appointed by and subject to the direction of the Council. A law firm, rather than an individual attorney, may serve as Law Director and in that case, an attorney of that firm may be designated by the Council to serve as the nominal Law Director. The attorney so designated shall serve with the title of Law Director, and other attorneys of that firm may serve as Acting Law Director with all the powers, duties and functions of the Law Director when the person designated as Law Director is not available. The Law Director shall serve as the chief legal advisor to the Council, the City Manager, and all City departments, boards, commissions, or authorities. The Law Director shall represent the City in all legal proceedings unless otherwise directed by the Council, and shall perform any other duties prescribed by this Charter, by ordinance or resolution or by the Administrative Code or the general laws of the State of Ohio. The person or firm holding the office of Law Director shall not be required to represent any school district or any other unit of government, other than the City, by virtue of holding the office of Law Director. When necessary, the Council may appoint special legal counsel to represent the City, together with, or in place of, the Law Director. (Amended 11-4-08.)</p>
