<p>layout: default title: &#8220;826&#46;19 SIGNS ASSOCIATED WITH NONCONFORMING LAND USES.&#8221;&#8212;</p>
<hr />
<p>In the case of lawfully nonconforming land uses (such as a business located in an area later zoned residential), the allowable message area shall be that which would be in effect if the existing use were located in the most restrictive zoning district allowing such land use. Further, no new signs associated with nonconforming land uses shall be erected, except replacements which are the same or smaller in size than the sign being replaced. In the event that a sign associated with a nonconforming land use is moved or replaced, its new location must conform to the setback requirements of the district in which it is located, as if it were a building. If a legal nonconforming land use is discontinued for more than six months, all signs associated with the discontinued use shall be deemed obsolete.</p>
