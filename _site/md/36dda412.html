<p>(a) No person, with knowledge of its character or content, shall recklessly do any of the following:</p>

<p>(1) Directly sell, deliver, furnish, disseminate, provide, exhibit, rent or present to a juvenile, a group of juveniles, a law enforcement officer posing as a juvenile, or a group of law enforcement officers posing as juveniles any material or performance that is obscene or harmful to juveniles;</p>

<p>(2) Directly offer or agree to sell, deliver, furnish, disseminate, provide, exhibit, rent or present to a juvenile, a group of juveniles, a law enforcement officer posing as a juvenile, or a group of law enforcement officers posing as juveniles any material or performance that is obscene or harmful to juveniles;</p>

<p>(3) While in the physical proximity of the juvenile or law enforcement officer posing as a juvenile, allow any juvenile or law enforcement officer posing as a juvenile to review or peruse any material or view any live performance that is harmful to juveniles.</p>

<p>(b) The following are affirmative defenses to a charge under this section, that involves material or a performance that is harmful to juveniles but not obscene:</p>

<p>(1) The defendant is the parent, guardian or spouse of the juvenile involved.</p>

<p>(2) The juvenile involved, at the time of the conduct in question, was accompanied by the juvenile&#8217;s parent or guardian who, with knowledge of its character, consented to the material or performance being furnished or presented to the juvenile.</p>

<p>(3) The juvenile exhibited to the defendant or the defendant&#8217;s agent or employee a draft card, driver&#8217;s license, birth certificate, marriage license, or other official or apparently official document purporting to show that the juvenile was eighteen years of age or over or married, and the person to whom that document was exhibited did not otherwise have reasonable cause to believe that the juvenile was under the age of eighteen and unmarried.</p>

<p>(c) (1) It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section, involving material or a performance that is obscene or harmful to juveniles, that the material or performance was furnished or presented for a bona fide medical, scientific, educational, governmental, judicial or other proper purpose, by a physician, psychologist, sociologist, scientist, teacher, librarian, clergyman, prosecutor, judge or other proper person.</p>

<p>(2) Except as provided in subsection (b)(3) hereof, mistake of age is not a defense to a charge under this section.</p>

<p>(d) (1) A person directly sells, delivers, furnishes, disseminates, provides, exhibits, rents, or presents or directly offers or agrees to sell, deliver, furnish, disseminate, provide, exhibit, rent, or present material or a performance to a juvenile, a group of juveniles, a law enforcement officer posing as a juvenile, or a group of law enforcement officers posing as juveniles in violation of this section by means of an electronic method of remotely transmitting information if the person knows or has reason to believe that the person receiving the information is a juvenile or the group of persons receiving the information are juveniles.</p>

<p>(2) A person remotely transmitting information by means of a method of mass distribution does not directly sell, deliver, furnish, disseminate, provide, exhibit, rent, or present or directly offer or agree to sell, deliver, furnish, disseminate, provide, exhibit, rent, or present the material or performance in question to a juvenile, a group of juveniles, a law enforcement officer posing as a juvenile, or a group of law enforcement officers posing as juveniles in violation of this section if either of the following applies:</p>

<p>A. The person has inadequate information to know or have reason to believe that a particular recipient of the information or offer is a juvenile.</p>

<p>B. The method of mass distribution does not provide the person the ability to prevent a particular recipient from receiving the information.</p>

<p>(e) If any provision of this section, or the application of any provision of this section to any person or circumstance, is held invalid, the invalidity does not affect other provisions or applications of this section or related sections that can be given effect without the invalid provision or application. To this end, the provisions are severable.</p>

<p>(f) Whoever violates this section is guilty of disseminating matter harmful to juveniles. If the material or performance involved is harmful to juveniles, except as otherwise provided in this subsection, a violation of this section is a misdemeanor of the first degree. If the material or performance involved is obscene, a violation of this section is a felony and shall be prosecuted under appropriate State law. (ORC 2907.31)</p>
