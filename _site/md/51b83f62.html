<p>After a public hearing is held, the City may order the abatement or demolition of the tower. The City may require the certificate holder or owner of the facility to pay for all expenses necessary to acquire or demolish the tower.</p>

<p>C. As a condition of the Zoning Inspector&#8217;s approval of a PWS Facility, the owner of the property upon which the PWS Facility is located shall be required to submit to the Zoning Inspector the owner&#8217;s covenant to undertake the responsibility and cost for the removal of a PWS Facility, which covenant shall be made enforceable by the City and recorded as a lien against the property. This lien shall be released after removal and final inspection and sign off by the Zoning Inspector or his designee. An Applicant must deposit with the City and for the benefit of the City Council a letter of credit, performance bond, or other security acceptable to the Zoning Inspector in an amount equal to the amount necessary to demolish and remove the facility. Any such guarantee shall be irrevocable and have an indemnity provision in favor of the City for costs, expenses, and attorney&#8217;s fees.</p>

<p>(4) Fences and walls. Each PWS Facility requiring the construction of a new tower shall be surrounded by an 8-foot high fence/wall and gate adequate to provide vehicular access to the base of the tower and the equipment shelter. The type, style and the material of the proposed fence/wall shall be approved by the Zoning Inspector as a part of the Zoning Certificate Application process. The fence/wall shall be installed along the perimeter of the site compound. The Zoning Inspector may in his sole discretion impose these fence/wall requirements on PWS Facilities utilizing existing support structures.</p>

<p>(5) Setbacks, fall zones and lot size. Towers associated with a PWS Facility shall be set back from all property lines a distance equal to the height of the tower.</p>

<p>To reduce the risk of personal injury or property damage, towers shall be located at least one hundred and twenty-five percent of their height from any building, street, bikeway, or pedestrian walkway. All other structures or equipment associated with a PWS Facility must comply with the appropriate setback requirements of the Zoning Ordinance.</p>

<p>Fee simple purchases for the lawful erection of the PWS facility need not conform to the minimum lot size requirements of the City Zoning Code, but shall not create a nonconformity for the remaining portion of any lot from which the land for the PWS facility was obtained.</p>

<p>(6) Tower height. No tower shall exceed 160 feet in height. However, the Zoning Inspector may approve a Zoning Certificate for a new tower whose proposed height exceeds 160 feet upon making written findings of fact and conclusions that the additional height allowed will further the City&#8217;s policy to encourage co-location of PWS Facilities and will not negatively affect safety and aesthetics.</p>

<p>(7) Modifications. Any modification to PWS Facility approved under this section, shall require the submission of a new Zoning Certificate Application in accordance with the provisions and requirements of subsection (b)(2)A. hereof. The Zoning Inspector may agree to waive certain submission requirements if, at his discretion, the Zoning Inspector believes such a waiver is justified.</p>

<p>(8) Prohibitions. No PWS Facility tower shall be illuminated in any manner unless such illumination is required by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). No PWS facility shall be located within a residential district. No tower may be located within the plain view of the Architectural District.</p>

<p>(9) Annual report and inspection. A PWS provider operating within the City limits must submit to the City an annual inventory of all PWS facilities owned and operated by the provider in the area. Additionally, each PWS provider must annually certify that any PWS facility within the City limits is being used and by whom that particular facility is being used. The owner of the tower must also annually provide to the City a list of all users of the tower and each user shall provide the City with a copy of each users license with the FCC.</p>

<p>The Applicant shall annually have any tower within the City inspected by an Ohio licensed structural engineer and furnish the engineer&#8217;s report of each such inspection to the City.</p>

<p>(10) Signs. The only signs allowed at a PWS facility shall be emergency information signs, owner contact information signs, warning or safety instructions, and signs required by a federal, state. or local agency. Such signs shall not exceed five square feet in area. All advertising or promotional signs are prohibited.</p>

<p>(11) Underground wiring. Underground wiring to the PWS facility and tower is required.</p>

<p>(12) Anti-climbing devices. All towers must be equipped with anticlimbing devices.</p>

<p>(13) Vehicular access. Vehicular access to the PWS facility shall be via the existing circulation system and be paved with asphalt or concrete. This access road must be at least ten feet in width between the public street and the gate to the fence enclosing the tower and equipment.</p>

<p>(14) Liability insurance. Within thirty (30) days following Zoning Certificate approval and annually thereafter, the Applicant shall provide continuous personal injury and property damage insurance with limits not less than one million dollars ($1,000,000) per claimant, per occurrence, with the City named as an additional insured. Proof of continuous maintenance of such insurance shall be submitted to the City on at least an annual basis.</p>

<p>(15) Renewal fee. On the first anniversary of the Zoning Certificate issuance and annually thereafter, the Applicant shall pay Zoning Certificate renewal fee of three hundred dollars ($300.00) to defray the City&#8217;s cost of reviewing the proofs of insurance and inspection reports, monitoring the appearance of the tower, maintaining the files and responding to citizen inquiries or problems related to the tower.</p>

<p>(16) Building and other permits. Separate building, electrical, plumbing and other permits may be required by the City or other agency for a PWS Facility or site compound as local requirements may prescribe.</p>

<p>(17) Enforcement. Any violation of this section by a certificate holder which continues for more than thirty days shall constitute sufficient cause for an order to be issued by the Zoning Inspector requiring removal of the PWS facility and its associated foundation, equipment, enclosure, and access paving. Any person who fails to either abide by such order or remedy the violation within sixty (60) days after actual receipt thereof shall be punishable in accord with the provisions of Section <a href='4da6057d.html'>1262.99</a> of the Codified Ordinances of Springboro.</p>

<p>Any tower which remains in place following the sixty day period for remediation set forth above, without full remediation of the violation having been made, is hereby declared to be a public and private nuisance. Such tower may, at the City&#8217;s option and after notice and hearing, be removed by the City without liability therefore, and the cost of such removal, including but not limited to demolition costs, transportation costs, disposal costs and legal fees and expenses may be recovered from the certificate holder or for the property owner of record by special assessment against the property, by civil action, by collection of the guarantee required by subsection (f)(3)C. hereof, or otherwise in accord with Ohio law generally providing for recovery of the governmental cost of abatement of nuisances.</p>

<p>(18) Severability. Should any part of this Section <a href='51b83f62.html'>1270.54</a> be found invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the remainder shall continue in full force and effect.</p>

<p>(Ord. 99-16. Passed 4-16-99.)</p>
