<p>​(a) Unless exempted in this chapter, a valid Certificate of Registration shall be required for each Utility Service Provider with any element of a Utility System located in a public Right of Way in the City.</p>

<p>​(b) The Utility Service Provider shall apply to the City Manager for a Certificate of Registration or the renewal of a Certificate of Registration. The City Manager shall determine the form of the application. An application shall include the following information and fee:</p>

<p>​(1) Detailed identification information about the Utility Service Provider; a copy of the current incorporation certificate of the applicant, if applicable; both regular and emergency contact information for the Utility Service Provider; a brief description of each utility service provided or proposed to be provided; a copy of each approval required by law, by any applicable authority, to provide any utility service described in the application; evidence of insurance coverage by the Utility Service Provider as set forth in Section <a href='424dfadd.html'>1028.41;</a> and any other relevant information the City Manager deems necessary to determine the fitness of the Utility Service Provider.</p>

<p>​(2) If requested by the City Manager or the applicant, the applicant Utility Service Provider and the City must meet to co-ordinate future plans for the public Right of Way between the Utility Service Provider and the City.</p>

<p>​(3) An application fee as set forth in Appendix A of Chapter <a href='58d37b9c.html'>1464</a>, to cover the costs of processing the application, shall be paid to the City at the time an application for a Certificate of Registration is filed with the City. No part of an application fee is returnable to the applicant.</p>

<p>​(c) Unless the applicant agrees to an extension of the maximum decision time, the City shall have a maximum time period of thirty (30) consecutive calendar days from the date a complete application for a Certificate of Registration by a Utility Service Provider is received by the City to make a decision on the application. Unless the applicant agrees to an extension of the maximum decision time, failure of the City to make a decision on an application for a Certificate of Registration shall be considered the same as an approval of the application by the City.</p>
