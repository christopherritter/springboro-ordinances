<p>​(i) Architectural Review. No permanent sign associated with a protected property in an architectural sign district shall be permitted unless it has first been issued a certificate of appropriateness by the City Architectural Review Board (ARB), pursuant to Chapter <a href='47ba3598.html'>1229.08</a>. In determining whether to grant approval, the ARB shall consider the following:</p>

<p>​(1) Is the sign appropriate in scale to the building with which it is associated?</p>

<p>​(2) Is the sign appropriate in design to the architectural style or period of the building with which it is associated?</p>

<p>​(3) Are the colors selected for the sign compatible with the building with which it is associated?</p>

<p>​(4) Is the sign located so as to reasonably minimize adverse aesthetic effects on the architectural design of the building with which it is associated?</p>

<p>Application for a certificate of appropriateness from the ARB shall be made to the City Building Inspection Department simultaneously with, or prior to, the application for the sign permit. Applications shall be on a form prescribed by the City, accompanied by a dimensioned scale drawing or dimensioned photograph of the sign indicating its typographic style, graphics, colors, supporting structure and other visual detail. Such applications shall bear no fee.</p>
