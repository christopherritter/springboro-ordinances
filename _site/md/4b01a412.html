<p>​(a) Conformance to Applicable Rules and Regulations. In addition to the requirements established in these regulations, all subdivisions shall comply with the following laws, rules, and regulations:</p>

<p>(1) All applicable state and federal statutory provisions.</p>

<p>​(2) Adopted plans and policies, and all other applicable laws of the City of Springboro or other appropriate jurisdictions.</p>

<p>​(3) The special requirements of these regulations and any rules of the Health Department and/or appropriate state or substate agencies.</p>

<p>​(4) The Standard Construction Drawings and Specifications established by the City Engineer.</p>

<p>​(5) Record plan approval may be withheld if a subdivision is not in conformity with the above laws, regulations, guidelines, and policies as well as the purposes of these regulations.</p>

<p>​(b) Subdivisions Straddling Municipal Boundaries. Whenever access to the subdivision is requested across land in another local government, the Planning Commission shall request assurance from the Law Director that access is legally established, and from the City Engineer that the access street is adequately improved, or that a guarantee has been duly executed and is sufficient in amount to assure the construction of the access street. In general, lot lines should be laid out so as not to cross municipal boundary lines.</p>

<p>​(c) Monuments. The applicant shall place permanent reference monuments in the subdivision certified by a professional surveyor. Concrete monuments shall be located along external subdivision boundaries and as determined by the City Engineer. Iron pins shall be located at all lot corners, points of tangency, curvature, at points as determined by the City Engineer. All monumentation shall be in accordance with the minimum standards outlined in ORC Section 4733.37.03.</p>

<p>​(d) Land Suitability. Land that the Planning Commission finds to be unsuitable for subdivision or development due to flooding, improper drainage, steep slopes, rock formation, adverse earth formations or topography, utility easements, or other features that will reasonably be harmful to the safety, health, and general welfare of the present or future inhabitants of the subdivision and/or its surrounding areas, shall not be subdivided or developed unless adequate methods are formulated by the developer and approved by the Planning Commission, upon recommendation of the City Engineer, to solve the problems created by the unsuitable land conditions. Such land shall be set aside for uses as shall not involve any danger to public health, safety, and welfare.</p>

<p>​(e) Street and Subdivision Names.**The proposed name of the subdivision or proposed streets shall not duplicate, or too closely approximate phonetically, the name of any other subdivision or thoroughfare in the fire district serving the City. The City Engineer in consultation with the Police Department shall have final authority to approve the names of the subdivisions and streets. In general, a street which is (or is planned as) a continuation, through an intersection, of an existing street shall bear the same name.</p>
