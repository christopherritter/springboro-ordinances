Where a proposed street intersects an existing street or streets, the elevation along the centerline of the existing street or streets within one hundred (100) feet of the intersection, shall be shown. Radii of all curves, lengths of tangents, central angles, stationing of points of curvature, and points of tangency on all streets shall be shown.</p>

<p>(3) Plans and profiles showing the locations of curbs and gutters, sidewalks, drainage easements, water and sanitary sewer service laterals, rights of way, manholes, and catch basins; street light poles and street signs; the location size and invert elevations of existing and proposed sanitary sewers, storm sewers and fire hydrants, showing connection to any existing or proposed utility systems; and exact location and size of all water, sanitary sewer and storm sewer utilities or structures.</p>
