<p>​(a) Effect of Approval. Except as otherwise provided in this section, no vested rights shall accrue to the owner or developer of any subdivision by reason of record plan approval until the actual signing of the record plan occurs.</p>

<p>​(b) Effect of Recordation. Except as otherwise provided in this section, no vested rights shall accrue to the owner or developer of any subdivision by virtue of the recordation of a record plan.</p>

<p>​(c) Applicable Laws. To obtain record plan approval, the applicant shall be in compliance with all federal and state laws applicable at the time that the final plan is considered for approval by the Planning Commission. The applicant also shall be in compliance with all local laws and regulations applicable at the time that the preliminary plat was submitted to the Planning Commission in accordance with Section <a href='4a4745af.html'>1244.04</a>, except that the applicant shall comply with those local laws and regulations in effect at the time that the final plan is considered for approval by the commission if the Planning Commission makes a determination on the record that compliance with any of those local laws and regulations is reasonably necessary to protect the public health and safety. If the Planning Commission required the applicant to complete public improvements in the subdivision prior to record plan approval, and the improvements have, in fact been completed, the applicant may be required to comply with local laws and regulations in effect at the time that the record plan is considered for approval only if the Planning Commission makes a finding on the record that such compliance is necessary to prevent a substantial risk of injury to public health, safety and general welfare.</p>
