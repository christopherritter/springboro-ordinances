<p>​(a) Holding Other Offices. Except where authorized by this Charter, neither a Council Member nor the Mayor shall hold any other City office or City employment during the term for which said Council Member or Mayor was elected or appointed to the Council, and no former Council Member or Mayor shall hold any compensated appointive City office or City employment until two (2) years after the expiration of the term for which he was elected or appointed except for an appointment to Council to fill an unexpired term pursuant to Section <a href='1353af4e.html'>4.05.</a> No member of the Council shall hold any incompatible office.</p>

<p>​(b) Appointment and Removals. Neither the Council nor any of its members, including the Mayor, shall in any manner dictate the appointment or removal of any City officers or employees whom the Manager or any subordinates are empowered to appoint or remove, but the Council as a body meeting with the Manager may express its views, and fully and freely discuss with the Manager anything pertaining to appointment and removal of such officers and employees.</p>

<p>​(c) Authority of Manager. The Council or its members shall deal with the City officers and employees who are subject to the direction and supervision of the Manager solely through the Manager, and neither the Council nor its members shall give any orders to any such officer or employee, either publicly or privately.</p>

<p>​(d) Personal Financial Interest. Any Council Member of the City who has a financial interest, direct or indirect, in any contract with the City or in the sale of any land, material or services to the City or to a contractor supplying the City shall make known that interest and shall refrain from voting upon or otherwise participating in that capacity as an elected official of the City in making of such sale or in the making or performance of such contract. Violation of this section with the knowledge, express or implied, of the person or corporation contracting with or making a sale to the City shall render the contract or sale voidable by the Council. (Amended 11-4-08.)</p>
