<p>(a) In case of accident to or collision with persons or property upon any of the public roads or highways, due to the driving or operation thereon of any motor vehicle, the person driving or operating the motor vehicle, having knowledge of the accident or collision, immediately shall stop the driver&#8217;s or operator&#8217;s motor vehicle at the scene of the accident or collision and shall remain at the scene of the accident or collision until the driver or operator has given the driver&#8217;s or operator&#8217;s name and address and, if the driver or operator is not the owner, the name and address of the owner of that motor vehicle, together with the registered number of that motor vehicle, to any person injured in the accident or collision or to the operator, occupant, owner, or attendant of any motor vehicle damaged in the accident or collision, or to any police officer at the scene of the accident or collision.</p>

<p>In the event the injured person is unable to comprehend and record the information required to be given by this section, the other driver involved in the accident or collision forthwith shall notify the nearest police authority concerning the location of the accident or collision, and the driver&#8217;s name, address and the registered number of the motor vehicle the driver was operating, and then remain at the scene of the accident or collision until a police officer arrives, unless removed from the scene by an emergency vehicle operated by a political subdivision or an ambulance.</p>

<p>Whoever violates subsection (a) of this section is guilty of failure to stop after an accident, a misdemeanor of the first degree. If the accident or collision results in serious physical harm or death to a person, failure to stop after an accident is a felony and shall be prosecuted under appropriate state law.</p>

<p>(b) Whoever violates subsection (a) of this section is guilty of failure to stop after an accident, a misdemeanor of the first degree.

<p>The court, in addition to any other penalties provided by law, shall impose upon the offender a class five suspension of the offender&#8217;s driver&#8217;s license, commercial driver&#8217;s license, temporary instruction permit, probationary license, or nonresident operating privilege from the range specified in division (A)(5) of Ohio R.C. 4510.02.
