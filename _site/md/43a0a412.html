<p>​(a) If, in the judgment of the Service Director, an approved backflow prevention device is necessary for the safety of the public water system, the Director shall give notice to the water consumer to install such an approved device. The water consumer, at his own expense, shall install such an approved device at a location and in a manner approved by the Director and shall have inspections and tests made of such approved devices as required by the Director.</p>

<p>​(b) No person, firm or corporation shall establish or permit to be established or maintain or permit to be maintained any connection whereby a private, auxiliary or emergency water supply other than the regular public water supply of the City may enter the supply or distributing system of the City, unless such private, auxiliary or emergency water supply and the method of connection and use of such supply shall have been approved by the Director and by the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency.</p>

<p>​(c) It shall be the duty of the Service Director to cause surveys and investigations to be made of industrial and other properties served by the public water supply where actual or potential hazards to the public water supply may exist. Such surveys and investigations shall be made a matter of public record and shall be repeated as often as the Director shall deem necessary.</p>

<p>​(d) The Service Director or his duly authorized representative shall have the right to enter at any reasonable time any property served by a connection to the public water supply or distributing system of the City for the purpose of inspecting the piping system or systems thereof. On demand the owner, lessees or occupants of any property so served shall furnish to the Director any information which he may request regarding the piping system or systems or water use on such property. The refusal of such information, when demanded, shall, within the discretion of the Director be deemed evidence of the presence of improper connections as provided in this section.</p>

<p>​(e) The Service Director is hereby authorized and directed to discontinue, after reasonable notice to the occupant thereof, the water service to any property wherein any connection in violation of the provisions of this section is known to exist, and to take such other precautionary measures as he may deem necessary to eliminate any danger of contamination of the public water supply distribution mains. Water service to such property shall not be restored until such conditions shall have been eliminated or corrected in compliance with the provisions of this section.</p>
