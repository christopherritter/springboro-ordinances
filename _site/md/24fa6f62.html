<p>(6) &#34;Body floor height&#34; means the vertical distance between top of the frame rail and the bottom of the passenger compartment (cab) floor. In the event that the vehicle is a truck body, floor height will be measured by the vertical distance between the passenger compartment (cab) floor and the floor of the truck bed.</p>

<p>(7) &#34;Bumper height&#34; means the vertical distance between the ground and the highest point of the bottom of the bumper, measured when the vehicle is laden on a level surface with the vehicle tires inflated to the manufacturer&#8217;s recommended pressure.</p>

<p>(8) &#34;Frame&#34; means the main longitudinal structural members of the chassis of the vehicle or, for vehicles with unitized body construction, the lowest main longitudinal structural members of the body of the vehicle.</p>

<p>(9) &#8220;Wheel track distance&#8221; means the distance on the ground between the center of the tire tread on one side of the vehicle, and the center of the tire tread on the opposite side. (OAC 4501-43-02)</p>
