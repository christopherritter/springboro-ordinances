  <h2 id='64224_determining_property_value_in_theft_offense'>642&#46;24 DETERMINING PROPERTY VALUE IN THEFT OFFENSE.</h2>

<p>(a) Where more than one item of property or service is involved in a theft offense, the value of the property or services involved for the purpose of determining the value is the aggregate value of all property or services involved in the offense.</p>

<p>(b) (1) When a series of offenses under Section <a href='32691a38.html'>642.34</a> involving a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, is committed by the offender in the offender&#8217;s same employment, capacity, or relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be tried as a single offense. The value of the property or services involved in the series of offenses for the purpose of determining the value is the aggregate value of all property and services involved in all offenses in the series.</p>

<p>(2) If an offender commits a series of offenses under Section <a href='32691a38.html'>642.34</a>, whether committed against one victim or more than one victim, involving a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, pursuant to a scheme or course of conduct, all of those offenses may be tried as a single offense. If the offenses are tried as a single offense, the value of the property or services involved for the purpose of determining the value is the aggregate value of all property and services involved in all of the offenses in the course of conduct.</p>

<p>(3) In prosecuting a single offense under subsection (b)(1) or (2), it is not necessary to separately allege and prove each offense in the series. Rather, it is sufficient to allege and prove that the offender, within a given span of time, committed one or more theft offenses in the offender&#8217;s same employment, capacity, or relationship to another as described in subsection (b)(1) of this section or that involve a common course of conduct to defraud multiple victims or a scheme or course of conduct as described in subsection (b)(2) of this section. While it is not necessary to separately allege and prove each offense in the series in order to prosecute a single offense under subsection (b)(1) or (2) hereof, it remains necessary in prosecuting them as a single offense to prove the aggregate value of the property or services in order to meet the requisite statutory offense level sought by the prosecution.</p>

<p>(c) The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of property or services involved in a theft offense:</p>

<p>(1) The value of an heirloom, memento, collector&#8217;s item, antique, museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that has intrinsic worth to its owner and that is either irreplaceable or is replaceable only on the expenditure of substantial time, effort or money, is the amount that would compensate the owner for its loss.</p>

<p>(2) The value of personal effects and household goods, and of materials, supplies, equipment and fixtures used in the profession, business, trade, occupation or avocation of its owner, which property is not covered under subsection (c)(1) hereof, and which retains substantial utility for its purpose regardless of its age or condition, is the cost of replacing the property with new property of like kind and quality.</p>

<p>(3) The value of any real or personal property that is not covered under subsections (c)(1) or (2) hereof, and the value of services, is the fair market value of the property or services. As used in this section, &#34;fair market value&#34; is the money consideration that a buyer would give and a seller would accept for property or services, assuming that the buyer is willing to buy and the seller is willing to sell, that both are fully informed as to all facts material to the transaction, and that neither is under any compulsion to act.</p>

<p>(d) Without limitation on the evidence that may be used to establish the value of property or services involved in a theft offense:</p>

<p>(1) When the property involved is personal property held for sale at wholesale or retail, the price at which the property was held for sale is prima-facie evidence of its value.</p>

<p>(2) When the property involved is a security or commodity traded on an exchange, the closing price or, if there is no closing price, the asked price, given in the latest market quotation prior to the offense, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the security or commodity.</p>

<p>(3) When the property involved is livestock, poultry or raw agricultural products for which a local market price is available, the latest local market price prior to the offense is prima-facie evidence of the value of the livestock, poultry or products.</p>

<p>(4) When the property involved is a negotiable instrument, the face value is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.</p>

<p>(5) When the property involved is a warehouse receipt, bill of lading, pawn ticket, claim check or other instrument entitling the holder or bearer to receive property, the face value or, if there is no face value, the value of the property covered by the instrument less any payment necessary to receive the property, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.</p>

<p>(6) When the property involved is a ticket of admission, ticket for transportation, coupon, token or other instrument entitling the holder or bearer to receive property or services, the face value or, if there is no face value, the value of the property or services that may be received thereby, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.</p>

<p>(7) When the services involved are gas, electricity, water, telephone, transportation, shipping or other services for which the rate is established by law, the duly established rate is prima-facie evidence of the value of the services.</p>

<p>(8) When the services involved are services for which the rate is not established by law, and the offender has been notified prior to the offense of the rate for the services, either in writing, or orally, or by posting ina manner reasonably calculated to come to the attention of potential offenders, the rate contained in the notice is prima-facie evidence of the value of the services.</p>
