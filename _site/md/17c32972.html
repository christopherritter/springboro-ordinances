<p>(a) There is hereby established a separate fund to be known as the &#8220;Springboro Police Department Forfeiture Proceeds Trust Fund&#8221;. Any proceeds from the forfeiture or sale of contraband, and any other proceeds received by the City in accordance with the provisions contained in Ohio R.C. 2933.43 shall be placed in this Fund. Expenditures from this Fund shall be limited to the following: the cost of protracted or complex investigations or prosecutions, the payment of reasonable technical training or expertise, providing matching funds to obtain federal grants to aid law enforcement, or providing for such law enforcement purposes as Council may determine to be appropriate by later resolution or ordinance. Council hereby authorizes the use of this Fund, in conformity with Ohio R.C. 2933.43(D)(1), for the benefit of the City D.A.R.E. Program. These Funds shall not be used to meet the operating costs of the Department that are unrelated to law enforcement. Interest, if any, derived from investments from this Fund shall be credited to such Fund.</p>

<p>(b) The Chief of the Police Department shall file a report with Council no later than the thirty-first day of January of each calendar year, verifying that the proceeds and forfeited moneys were expended only for the purposes authorized by this section and Ohio R.C. 2933.43(D)(3)(a)(ii) and specifying the amounts expended for each authorized purpose.</p>

<p>(c) The Department shall adopt, in conformity with Ohio R.C. 2933.43, a written internal control policy providing that at least ten percent (10%) of the first one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000) of proceeds and forfeited moneys deposited during each calendar year and at least twenty percent (20%) of the proceeds and forfeited moneys exceeding one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000) that are so deposited, shall be used in connection with community preventive education programs which includes, but not limited to D.A.R.E. Programs and other programs designed to educate adults or children with respect to the dangers associated with the use of drugs of abuse.</p>
