<p>A. Any manufacturer&#8217;s tinting or glazing of motor vehicle windows or windshields that is otherwise in compliance with or permitted by &#8220;Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard Number 205&#34; (FMVSS 205) in effect at the time of the manufacture of the motor vehicle until such standard is subsequently repealed or reduced.
