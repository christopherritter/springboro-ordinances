<p>In addition to all other signs permitted by this chapter, and notwithstanding limitations as to allowable message area, interstate highway signs shall be permitted, subject to the following regulations:</p>

<p>​(a) Interstate highway signs shall be permitted only on parcels which are either entirely or partially within 550 feet from the point of intersection of the extended centerline of the pavement of the Northbound &#8220;off&#8221; ramp from Interstate 75 with the centerline of the right-of-way of State Route 73.</p>

<p>​(b) Each Interstate highway sign shall be located and oriented so that its message area is clearly and continuously visible from at least one direction of travel on the interstate highway for at least five seconds before the viewing motorist reaches the entrance to either the Northbound or Southbound exit ramp from Interstate 75 to State Route 73, when the motorist is traveling at the maximum speed permitted.</p>

<p>​(c) No more than one Interstate highway sign may be erected on a single parcel. Interstate Highway Signs may only be located on the parcel which the business use being advertised actually occupies.</p>

<p>​(d) Interstate highway signs shall not exceed sixty feet in height. A variance permitting a greater height may be granted by the Board of Zoning Appeals only if all the following conditions are present:</p>

<p>​(1) The sixty foot height limitation prevents compliance with subsection (b) hereof due to one or more visual obstructions. For the purpose of this subsection (d), other signs shall not be regarded as visual obstructions.</p>

<p>​(2) The effect of the obstructions cannot be feasiblely avoided by locating the sign elsewhere on the same parcel for which the sign is proposed.</p>

<p>​(3) The height granted by the variance is no more than ten feet greater than necessary to satisfy the visibility requirement of subsection (b) hereof.</p>

<p>​(4) The location of the sign will not interfere with the continuing compliance of a previously existing sign to the visibility requirement of subsection (b) hereof.</p>

<p>​(e) Each application for a permit for an Interstate highway sign shall be accompanied by the certification of an Ohio-registered architect or engineer that the proposed sign meets all applicable structural safety standards.</p>

<p>​(f) The message area of an Interstate highway sign shall not exceed 120 square feet. This message area shall not be included in the calculation of total message area.</p>

<p>​(g) Interstate highway signs with an overall height greater than twenty-five feet shall be supported by a single pole or standard. All poles or standards used to support Interstate Highway Signs shall be painted white. Wood poles or standards shall not be permitted.</p>

<p>​(h) Interstate highway signs shall be set back a distance of at least eight feet from all public rights-of-way, and shall not be permitted at any location where vehicular sight distances are adversely affected.</p>

<p>​(i) Interstate highway signs shall comply with applicable state and federal laws.</p>
