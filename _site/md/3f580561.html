The portion of a net operating loss sustained in any taxable year (subsequent to the date of the first ordinance permitting loss carry-forwards), allocable to the Municipality, may be applied against the portion of the profit of succeeding years, until exhausted, but in no event for more than three taxable years. No portion of a net operating loss shall be carried back against the net profits of any prior year.</p>

<p>(Ord. 00-66. Passed 12-21-00.)</p>

<p>(Ord. 97-44. Passed 7-17-97.)</p>

<p>(2) The portion of a net operating loss sustained shall be allocated to the Municipality in the same manner as provided in this section for allocating net profits to the Municipality.</p>

<p>deem necessary to ascertain whether or not net profits are properly allocated to the Municipality. If the Administrator finds net profits are not properly allocated to the Municipality by reason of transactions with stockholders or with other corporations related by stock ownership, interlocking directorates or transactions with such division, branch, factory, office, laboratory or activity, or by some other method, he or she shall make such allocation as he or she deems appropriate to produce a fair and proper allocation of net profits to the Municipality.</p>

<p>(e) Exceptions. The tax provided for in this chapter shall not be levied upon income from interest, dividends, capital gains, unemployment, retirement, military pay or allowances of members of the Armed Forces of the United States, or upon the net profits of any civic, charitable, religious, fraternal or other organization specified in Ohio R.C. 718.01 to the extent that such net profits are exempted from Municipal income taxes under such sections.</p>
