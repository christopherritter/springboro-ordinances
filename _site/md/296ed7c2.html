  <h2 id='60607_requirements_for_criminal_liability'>606&#46;07 REQUIREMENTS FOR CRIMINAL LIABILITY.</h2>

<p>(a) Except as provided in subsection (b) hereof, a person is not guilty of an offense unless both of the following apply:</p>

<p>(1) The person&#8217;s liability is based on conduct that includes either a voluntary act, or an omission to perform an act or duty that the person is capable of performing;</p>

<p>(2) The person has the requisite degree of culpability for each element as to which a culpable mental state is specified by the section defining the offense.</p>

<p>(b) When the section defining an offense does not specify any degree of culpability, and plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict criminal liability for the conduct described in the section, then culpability is not required for a person to be guilty of the offense. When the section neither specifies culpability nor plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict liability, recklessness is sufficient culpability to commit the offense.</p>

<p>(c) Voluntary intoxication may not be taken into consideration in determining the existence of a mental state that is an element of a criminal offense. Voluntary intoxication does not relieve a person of a duty to act if failure to act constitutes a criminal offense. Evidence that a person was voluntarily intoxicated may be admissible to show whether or not the person was physically capable of performing the act with which the person is charged.</p>

<p>(d) As used in this section:</p>

<p>(1) Possession is a voluntary act if the possessor knowingly procured or received the thing possessed, or was aware of the possessor&#8217;s control of the thing possessed for a sufficient time to have ended possession.</p>

<p>(2) Reflexes, convulsions, body movements during unconsciousness or sleep, and body movements that are not otherwise a product of the actor&#8217;s volition, are involuntary acts.</p>

<p>(3) &#34;Culpability&#34; means purpose, knowledge, recklessness or negligence, as defined in Section<a href='292aa73d.html'>606.02</a>.</p>

<p>(4) &#8220;Intoxication&#8221; includes, but is not limited to, intoxication resulting from the ingestion of alcohol, a drug, or alcohol and a drug.</p>
