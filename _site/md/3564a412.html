<p>​(a) A brazier, salamander, space heater, room heater, furnace, water heater or other burner or heater using wood, coal, coke, fuel oil, kerosene, gasoline, natural gas, liquid petroleum gas or similar fuel, and tending to give off carbon monoxide or other harmful gas:</p>

<p>​(1) When used in living quarters, or in any enclosed building or space in which persons are usually present, shall be used with a flue or vent so designed, installed and maintained as to vent the products of combustion outdoors; except in storage, factory or industrial buildings which are provided with sufficient ventilation to avoid the danger of carbon monoxide poisoning;</p>

<p>​(2) When used as a portable or temporary burner or heater at a construction site, or in a warehouse, shed or structure in which persons are temporarily present, shall be vented as provided in subsection (a) hereof, or used with sufficient ventilation to avoid the danger of carbon monoxide poisoning.</p>

<p>​(b) This section does not apply to domestic ranges, laundry stoves, gas logs installed in a fireplace with an adequate flue, or hot plates, unless the same are used as space or room heaters.</p>

<p>​(c) No person shall negligently use, or, being the owner, person in charge, or occupant of premises, negligently permit the use of a burner or heater in violation of the standards for venting and ventilation provided in this section.</p>

<p>​(d) Subsection (a) hereof does not apply to any kerosene-fired space or room heater that is equipped with an automatic extinguishing tip-over device, or to any natural gas-fired or liquid petroleum gas-fired space or room heater that is equipped with an oxygen depletion safety shutoff system, and that has its fuel piped from a source outside of the building in which it is located, that are approved by an authoritative source recognized by the State Fire Marshal in the State Fire Code adopted by him under Ohio R.C. 3737.82.</p>

<p>​(e) The State Fire Marshal may make rules to ensure the safe use of unvented kerosene, natural gas or liquid petroleum gas heaters exempted from subsection (a) hereof when used in assembly buildings, business buildings, high hazard buildings, institutional buildings, mercantile buildings and type R-1 and R-2 residential buildings, as these groups of buildings are defined in rules adopted by the Board of Building Standards under Ohio R.C. 3781.10. No person shall negligently use, or, being the owner, person in charge or occupant of premises, negligently permit the use of a heater in violation of any rules adopted under this subsection.</p>

<p>​(f) The State Fire Marshal may make rules prescribing standards for written instructions containing ventilation requirements and warning of any potential fire hazards that may occur in using a kerosene, natural gas, or liquid petroleum gas heater. No person shall sell or offer for sale any kerosene, natural gas or liquid petroleum gas heater unless the manufacturer provides with the heater written instructions that comply with any rules adopted under this subsection.</p>

<p>​(g) No product labeled as a fuel additive for kerosene heaters and having a flash point below one hundred degrees fahrenheit or thirty-seven and eight-tenths degrees centigrade shall be sold, offered for sale or used in any kerosene space heater.</p>

<p>​(h) No device that prohibits any safety feature on a kerosene, natural gas or liquid petroleum gas space heater from operating shall be sold, offered for sale or used in connection with any kerosene, natural gas or liquid petroleum gas space heater.</p>

<p>​(i) No person shall sell or offer for sale any kerosene-fired, natural gas or liquid petroleum gas-fired heater that is not exempt from subsection (a) hereof unless it is marked conspicuously by the manufacturer on the container with the phrase &#8220;Not Approved For Home Use.&#8221;</p>

<p>​(j) No person shall use a cabinet-type, liquid petroleum gas-fired heater having a fuel source within the heater, inside any building, except as permitted by the State Fire Marshal in the State Fire Code adopted by him under Ohio R.C. 3737.82. (ORC 3701.82)</p>

<p>​(k) Whoever violates this section is guilty of a misdemeanor of the first degree.</p>
